North Korea frequently conducts missile and nuclear tests around the annual military exercises and important anniversaries. The latest missile launch was the second such incident this year; North Korea fired a medium-range ballistic missile off its eastern coast on 12 February. Previous nuclear tests and missile launches have prompted the imposition of UN-led and bilateral international sanctions on North Korea, which, in turn, is liable to prompt further bellicose rhetoric from the North.<br/>\n<p>Further provocative acts are increasingly probable until the joint exercises conclude, and if the US goes ahead with its plans to deploy an anti-missile defence system in South Korea. Nonetheless, the latest developments should not be viewed as a prelude to a military confrontation between North Korea and the US, South Korea or Japan. Precedents also indicate that North Korea may carry out small-scale and localised acts of military provocation – including exchanges of artillery fire – along the DMZ and the disputed maritime border in the Yellow Sea (West Sea). However, such incidents are unlikely to target civilian areas on the mainland.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

In December 2016, a French tourist was suspected of contracting Zika whilst in Angola, however tests were not conclusive. The second case, an Angolan who lives in Luanda, tested positive for Zika in January 2017. The Ministry of Health has increased their surveillance throughout the country.</p>\n<p>Zika is a viral disease, mostly transmitted to people by mosquito bites. Zika virus can be passed from an infected pregnant mother to her baby. Spread through sexual contact occurs. Transmission via blood transfusion has occurred. Most people who have Zika infections do not have any symptoms. If symptoms occur, they are similar to chikunguyna or dengue, and include fever, rash, joint and muscle pains or conjunctivitis (red eyes), and typically last up to a week. The virus can cause severe irreversible birth defects, such as \"microcephaly\" (a small head with developmental abnormalities), and serious neurological complications. There is no specific treatment available, and no vaccine to prevent the disease.</p>\n<p>Zika may have been established in the local mosquito population in parts of Angola, however the extent and intensity of spread is uncertain at this time.</p>\nFor more information:<br/>\n<ul> <li>See the <a href=\"https://pandemic.internationalsos.com/zika\" target=\"_blank\">International SOS Zika website</a>. </li> <li>See \"Zika virus\" in the Diseases and Prevention dropdown on International SOS Country Guides. </li> <li>Contact any International SOS assistance centre.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p>The situation is continuing to evolve.

If you are accosted by a criminal, assume that your assailant is armed; do nothing to resist or antagonise them.</li> <li>Understand the basic geography of your destination, and ensure you familiarise yourselves with key routes: avoid high-crime or low-income areas if possible.</li> <li>Expect, but do not be unduly disturbed by, a heightened military and police presence.</li> <li>Monitor our alerts on the Bahamas for further developments.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>Pickpocketing, purse-snatching, burglary and armed robbery are the most commonly reported crimes against foreigners in major cities in the Bahamas. Foreign travellers may be targeted because of their perceived wealth. Criminal incidents are regularly reported near major tourist hotels, especially at night. In the capital Nassau, the 'Over-the-Hill' district to the south of the city centre and isolated beaches remain particularly vulnerable to crime after dark. While there have been reports of an increase in violent crime, such incidents usually occur in low-income and underdeveloped areas. </p>\n<p>The Royal Bahamas Police Force (RBPF) has a reputation for efficiency and effectiveness. However, the deployment of military personnel indicates perceived inadequacies in the abilities of law enforcement officers to both defend themselves and quell the latest crime wave, as well as a lack of unified policy among Bahamian security institutions. </p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Several of the suspects were thought to be planning attacks in Bahrain after receiving training in Iran and Iraq. While the development underlines the latent threat posed by militancy in the country, it does not indicate any significant change in the overall security environment. Normal travel can continue with standard precautions.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><ul> <li>While travel to Bahrain can continue with standard precautions, there is an underlying risk of minor attacks by militants or radicalised opposition activists. Minimise time around likely targets, including government and security force personnel and facilities, particularly outside the capital Manama.</li> <li>Protests can degenerate into clashes between the security forces and protesters. Demonstrators may throw Molotov cocktails and other projectiles at police officers, while the security forces often use tough measures such as tear gas to disperse unruly crowds. Avoid all demonstrations as a standard security precaution.</li> <li>Monitor our alerts, consult our Bahrain pages or contact your nearest Assistance Centre for additional information and advice.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>The militant cell was allegedly involved in the 1 January escape of convicted militants from the Jau jail (Southern governorate), in which ten of its members broke out from prison. The authorities announced that members of the cell had received instruction from abroad for previous low-level attacks carried out in Bahrain. Further attacks are believed to have been in the planning phase after the suspects had travelled to Iran and Iraq for training. </p>\n<p>Previously, on 21 February, the interior ministry announced the arrests of 20 of the 25 suspects, during several raids from 9-19 February. Explosives were also confiscated in these operations. Several of the escaped convicts were killed on 8 February trying to flee the country by boat. According to the Bahraini authorities, the cell included a total 41 members in Bahrain, 12 defendants in Iran and Iraq and another in Germany.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>Violent militant incidents increased slightly around the 14 February anniversary of the 2011 'Arab Spring' protests in Bahrain, as did opposition activity. Violence primarily affected outlying predominantly Shia village areas outside the capital Manama. The increase in opposition activity is unlikely to be sustained in the coming months. Militant activity remains a persistent underlying issue. However, as demonstrated by this latest incident the security forces remain largely capable of uncovering and thwarting militant cells.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

There is currently no known evidence that IS is providing funding, weapons or other material support to enhance the operational capabilities of local militants. However, transnational Islamist militant networks, including IS and al-Qaida, are believed to be operating through connections with local affiliates.</p>\n<p>The authorities have continued to issue denials on the existence of transnational militant networks in the country. Instead, established domestic militant groups such as the JMB, the Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) as well as the Ansar al-Islam (Al) are often blamed for carrying out attacks, driven in part by persistent political instability and the marginalisation of Islamic political parties.</p>\n<p>Local militant groups' activities are likely to continue to consist of small-scale attacks using knives/machetes, and easily acquired small arms, crude explosive devices. The most likely target for attack will remain civil society members and institutions seen as preventing these groups from Islamising Bangladeshi society. Government-affiliated buildings, rallies or events, as well as security force personnel and infrastructure are also key targets.</p>\n<p>The authorities have the capacity to co-ordinate and react to intelligence and prevent high profile or complex attacks. However, they are likely to find it increasingly difficult to detect and prevent one-off attacks against lower-security soft targets where foreigners congregate such as bars and restaurants, including those in the upscale Gulshan, Banani and Baridhara areas of Dhaka. Thus, the primary risk to foreigners remains incidental exposure to militant violence.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Militants may also target civil society members and institutions seen as preventing the Islamisation of Bangladeshi society, including foreigners associated with missionary and non-Muslim religious charities. Such attacks may take the form of opportunistic and narrowly targeted killings of foreign nationals, as witnessed in late September and early October 2015. </p>\n<p>In addition, militants have shown increasing determination to directly target foreigners to maximise international attention, as seen in the 1-2 July attack, or to undermine the legitimacy of the ruling Awami League. Consequently, densely crowded locations - where even small explosions or gun attacks can result in high casualty figures - are increasingly vulnerable. Exposure to attacks in these locations, including marketplaces, pilgrimage sites, religious festivals, low-security commercial districts and transport hubs - represents the primary terrorism-related threat to foreigners in the country.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Over 350 cases have been confirmed, however around 1,400 suspected cases, and at least 224 deaths, have been reported. More cases are expected, and further geographic expansion may occur, due to people moving between states, yellow fever infection in monkeys and low vaccination coverage. The confirmed cases were identified in Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo and Sao Paulo. Minas Gerais remains the state with the highest activity.</p>\n<p>Bahia, Goias, Rio Grande do Norte and Tocantins have suspected cases under investigation. Areas of Bahia, Goias and Tocantins are known risk areas for yellow fever transmission, however to date Rio Grande do Norte has not been considered a state with risk of yellow fever transmission.</p>\n<p>Health authorities have increased distribution of yellow fever vaccine and implemented vector control activities in response the the outbreak.</p>\n<p>What is Yellow Fever?</p>\n<p>Yellow fever is a viral disease that occurs in parts of Africa and South America. It is transmitted by mosquitoes. Although some people infected with yellow fever only have a mild illness, others develop a serious toxic form of the disease. The symptoms range from a mild influenza-like syndrome to a severe hemorrhagic fever with liver failure. There is no specific treatment for the disease. Between 20%-50% of people who have a severe case of yellow fever die from the disease. Because yellow fever can spread easily, many countries require proof of an up-to-date yellow fever vaccination before they allow travellers to enter the nation. Some require all travellers to be vaccinated before entry, while others only require vaccination if you have recently travelled from an infected (or endemic) country.</p>\n<p>Yellow Fever Vaccination</p>\n<p>Vaccination is only available through designated yellow fever vaccination clinics.

However, other cosmopolitan urban centres of Anglophone regions such as <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/SLNhFv3N6Y42\" target=\"_blank\">Limbe</a> (Southwest) were less affected. Discontent among students over a prolonged suspension of classes, which could lead to an annulment of the academic year, is liable to trigger related unrest in the short-to-medium term. </p>\n<p>A continued internet shutdown in both regions appears to be an attempt by the authorities to pre-empt further demonstrations, which remain possible in urban centres, particularly Buea and Bamenda. Meanwhile, the three Anglophone activists being tried in Yaounde could face the death penalty if convicted. Renewed demonstrations at the military court and outside the city's <a href=\"https://goo.gl/ZFnoh5\" target=\"_blank\">Kondengui prison</a>, where the activists are being held, are liable to take place on 23 March and during future trial hearings. </p>\n<p>The secessionist Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium (CACSC) and the Southern Cameroons National Council (SCNC), whose meetings and demonstrations have been banned since 17 January, are leading a protest campaign against the perceived marginalisation of Anglophone communities by Cameroon's Francophone majority.

If you develop symptoms, ensure that you see a doctor.</li> <li>Pregnant women - consult your doctor. You may be advised to be tested for Zika whether or not you develop symptoms. Your doctor may also arrange additional monitoring or specialist care.</li> <li>Prevent sexual transmission - Anyone who has a pregnant partner should use condoms (applicable to males and females) or abstain for the duration of the pregnancy. For those whose partners are not pregnant, authorities differ in their recommendations for the duration for which precautions should continue. <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/sexual-transmission-prevention/en/\" target=\"_blank\">The World Health Organization advises</a> that everyone should continue precautions for at least 6 months after return. <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/protect-yourself-during-sex.html\" target=\"_blank\">The United States CDC advises</a>: <strong>Men</strong> should continue precautions for at least 6 months; <strong>Women </strong>to continue precautions for at least 8 weeks. </li> <li>Consider delaying pregnancy - The World Health Organization <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/sexual-transmission-prevention/en/\" target=\"_blank\">recommends</a> couples or women planning a pregnancy, who have returned from an area with Zika transmission, to wait at least 6 months.

Zika virus can be passed from an infected pregnant mother to her baby. Spread through sexual contact (from men) occurs. Transmission via blood transfusion has occurred. Most people who have Zika infections do not have any symptoms. If symptoms occur, they are similar to chikunguyna or dengue, and include fever, rash, joint and muscle pains or conjunctivitis (red eyes), and typically last up to a week. The virus can cause severe irreversible birth defects, such as \"microcephaly\" (a small head with developmental abnormalities), and serious neurological complications. There is no specific treatment available, and no vaccine to prevent the disease.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information:<br/>\n<ul> <li>See the <a href=\"https://pandemic.internationalsos.com/zika\" target=\"_blank\">International SOS Zika website</a>. </li> <li>See \"Zika virus\" in the Diseases and Prevention dropdown on International SOS Country Guides. </li> <li>Contact any International SOS assistance centre.</li>\n</ul>\n</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>The virus is likely present in the local mosquito population and further human cases may occur.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice for managers</b></p><p>If relevant to your employees or travellers, ensure they are aware of:</p>\n<ul> <li>Regional health threats including Zika, who is most at risk (such as pregnant women), and prevention strategies. </li> <li>Who to contact for advice and treatment if they get sick during or after travel. </li> <li>How to access bite prevention resources including insect repellent and bed nets. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consider: <br/></p>\n<ul> <li>Providing a travel health kit, including insect repellent. </li> <li>Stipulating a medical pre-travel consultation. </li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

The vast majority have been caused by the A(H7N9) strain, with a few due to A(H5N6). At least one case of A(H9N2) was detected and has since recovered. Most of those infected had direct contact with poultry.</p>\n<p>Anhui, Guangdong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang have reported the most cases this season. Imported cases have been reported in Beijing and Yunnan. Macao and Hong Kong have had a number of cases which were imported from the mainland. Taiwan has reported one imported case in 2017 from Guangdong Province.</p>\n<p>The World Health Organization <a href=\"http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/avian_influenza/riskassessment_AH7N9_201702/en/\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> three possible clusters where human to human transmission of the virus could not be ruled out.</p>\n<p>What is Bird Flu?<br/>\n<br/>\nBird flu, also known as avian influenza, refers to influenza A viruses that usually affect birds. Some strains can cause large outbreaks in poultry (farmed birds), causing flocks to suddenly die. As migratory wild birds can carry the virus without becoming ill, they can spread the viruses from area to area and even continent to continent.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome bird flu viruses infect humans. The H5N1 and H7N9 strains have infected hundreds of people, while a number of other bird flu viruses (including H5N6 and H10N8) are rarely occur in humans. The H9N2 strain is consistently found in poultry in China and causes infrequent human infection, usually after direct contact with poultry or contaminated environments.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople get bird flu from direct contact with infected birds or their environment, although in some cases there was no such exposure (and it is unknown how these people were infected), and in some cases limited human-to-human transmission occurred. Symptoms develop usually 2-5 days after exposure to infection, although this may extend up to 17 days. Symptoms are of fever, cough, and some strains typically cause conjunctivitis (redness of the eyes). Some strains, including H7N9, H5N6 and H5N1 are capable of progressing to severe disease with breathing difficulty and lung failure, and the fatality rate can be around 30%. Treatment is with antiviral medication.</p>\n<p>For more information:</p>\n<ul> <li>See \"Avian Influenza H7N9\" and \"Avian Influenza H5N1\" in the \"Diseases and Prevention\" dropdown on the International SOS Country Guides</li> <li>See the Traveller Advice and Avian Flu pages on the <a href=\"http://pandemic.internationalsos.com/\" target=\"_blank\">International SOS Pandemic Information Website</a></li> <li>Contact the Beijing, China Assistance Centre: +86 (0)10 6462 9100 or any International SOS assistance centre</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n</p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>Bird flu viruses are consistently present in birds in many areas of China. More sporadic cases are likely to be reported in people who have direct contact with live poultry, and the seasonal increase is expected to continue. Small clusters of human to human transmission may be recorded in family members and others who are in close contact with symptomatic people, however the risk to the general traveller who avoids contact with live poultry and their environment is low.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice for managers</b></p><p>If relevant to your employees or travellers, ensure they: </p>\n<ul> <li>Are aware of regional health threats including avian influenza.</li> <li>Use personal hygiene measures, including frequent hand washing.</li> <li>Consider taking a travel health kit, including hand sanitiser.</li> <li>Know what to do if they get sick during and after travel.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.internationalsos.com//~/media/dynamic-content/alert-maps/february-2017/china_h7n9_5feb2017.jpg\"/></p>]]>"

The ELN also claimed credit for a 14 February roadside explosion targeting a military patrol and injuring two soldiers on the Bogota-Villavicencio highway in Piripal (Meta department), in addition to a series of bomb attacks on 15-18 February on the Cano Limon-Covenas oil pipeline in Norte de Santander department. While normal travel can continue to Bogota, the development serves as reminder of the risks posed by guerilla activity.<br/></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><ul> <li>While normal travel can continue to Bogota, be alert to suspicious behaviour and report any suspect packages to the authorities.</li> <li>Continue to avoid non-essential travel to areas of high guerrilla activity. Avoid unnecessary overland travel outside major urban areas. Necessary overland travel should only be undertaken after seeking itinerary-specific advice, in daylight hours, in convoy and after ascertaining that the route remains secure immediately prior to departure.</li> <li>There is a low but credible risk of terrorist attack in Colombia. Government personnel and buildings, military personnel and facilities, and crowded shopping and entertainment venues are likely targets. </li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>Although leftist guerrilla groups have periodically targeted Bogota, the frequency of such incidents in recent years has been low. The main leftist guerrilla Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) is in the midst of a disarmament process after reaching a peace agreement with the government, while the ELN on 7 February officially commenced peace talks with the authorities in Quito (Ecuador). The 19 February attack – reportedly caused by a homemade bomb in the vicinity of the Plaza de Toros La Santamaria (Santamaria Bullring) in Bogota – was likely perpetrated in an attempt to exert pressure on the government and undermine its stance amid the peace talks. </p>\n<p>While the government has had notable counter-terrorism successes in recent years, the ELN announcement is indicative that narco-terrorist groups such as the ELN retain the capability to perpetrate attacks in both metropolitan and rural areas. Government personnel and buildings, military personnel and facilities, and crowded shopping and entertainment venues remain likely targets. The ELN is also attributed with an attack on 28 December 2016 in Bogota's greater metropolitan area; one police officer was killed and seven others were injured in the incident in the Torca neighbourhood, which involved gunmen on a motorcycle fatally shooting the police officer, planting explosives on his body and detonating it when other police officers arrived on the scene.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p>Further sporadic small-scale bombings by guerrilla groups are possible in Bogota, though these do not represent a heightened risk to travellers in the capital. In general, such incidents are rare in the country's main business and touristic areas and the risks to foreign travellers are limited. Guerrilla units are mostly active in rural areas, where they more frequently carry out attacks on the security forces and on key infrastructure. As such, the ELN is likely to continue its activities, including attacks in its areas of operation, notably Arauca, Narino and Norte de Santander departments. <br/></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Ensure that you are confident in your accommodation, transport and security arrangements and are fully briefed on the prevailing threats and necessary security measures prior to travel. Ensure you know what to do in the event of a medical emergency or security incident. </li> <li>Take precautions to mitigate the risk of kidnap, such as keeping a low profile and avoiding routines; for example, vary routes taken between home and work. Maintain strict discretion regarding proposed routes, family and financial details, as local people occasionally act as informants for criminal gangs.</li> <li>Remain alert for signs of being watched or observed; this includes static surveillance of premises or office and other vulnerable points, such as when returning to a vehicle. If you notice something suspicious, relocate immediately to a secure location and report it to the authorities. If travelling in convoy, ensure that a reasonable distance is kept between vehicles so that bandits are unable to attack multiple vehicles in a single ambush.</li> <li>Register with your embassy and all relevant warden networks prior to travel and liaise closely with local stakeholders while in country; ensure you receive our alerts for Congo (DRC) prior to and during your stay. </li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>The kidnapping was allegedly carried out by armed members of the Raia Mutomboki militia group, which is predominately active in the North and South Kivu province. However, other sources indicate that it was perpetrated by members of local communities over the dislodging of artisanal diggers. The three Congolese have reportedly been released, while the other victims are still being held hostage. In addition to the ransom, the attackers left leaflets around the mine, threatening its workers. The incident is currently under investigation by the authorities. </p>\n<p>The incident follows a number of other attacks on gold mines in eastern regions over the past few months. On 7 February, an armed attack was carried out against Twangiza gold mine in the Mwenga area, around 28 miles (45km) south-west of Bukavu city (South Kivu province), resulting in the deaths of three policemen and one assailant, before being eventually repelled by the police. </p>\n<p>While rebel groups generally focus on local civilians and the security forces, foreigners may be targeted due to their perceived wealth, with foreign kidnap victims often quickly released once financial deals have been struck. Rebel groups also engage in roadside banditry and extortion of motorists on main roads, and opportunistic attacks on foreign travellers therefore cannot be ruled out.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Members in other urban centres keep abreast of local developments and maintain flexible itineraries.</li> <li>Related events could also take place on the day in Tshisekedi's native province of Kasai-Oriental; avoid any such gatherings as a precautionary measure.</li> <li>Remain alert at all times and avoid all gatherings.

His brother Gerard Mulumba on 6 March indicated that they no longer want Tshisekedi to be buried in the Gombe cemetery, as Kinshasa's local residents reportedly oppose the burial's location, while the UDPS continues to demand that Tshisekedi be buried in his stronghold of Limete in Kinshasa. Mulumba said negotiations are under way and that the repatriation could nevertheless take place on 11 March should a consensus over another location be found.</p>\n<p>On the day of the repatriation, Tshisekedi's mortal remains are expected to arrive at Ndjili International Airport (FIH), where thousands of opposition supporters are likely to gather before engaging in a procession, causing travel disruption along Boulevard Patrice Lumumba, linking the airport to the city centre. A visibly augmented security force presence will be observed in Kinshasa in the run-up to and on the day of the burial. Confrontations between police and opposition activists are possible around the burial's date, particularly in the Limete area, where the UDPS headquarters and Tshisekedi's residence are located, respectively on <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/awHfvZZocyS2\" target=\"_blank\">11th Street</a> and <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/Ai1CU6v16TR2\" target=\"_blank\">10th Street</a>.</p>\n<p>While Kinshasa will be primarily affected by related disruption, other locations that may see unrest as a result of the repatriation of Tshisekedi's body include the Kasai provinces, as he is a native of Kasai-Oriental province where he was widely popular. Events could be organised locally on the day though no details are yet available. Associated gatherings are also possible in Lubumbashi (Haut-Katanga province), Goma (North Kivu province), Mbuji-Mayi (Kasai-Oriental), Boma and Matadi (Kongo Central province).</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>Details of the repatriation of Tshisekedi's remains from Brussels (Belgium) and funeral were initially released on 28 February by his family, before being postponed on 6 March, after weeks of negotiations between the government and the UDPS regarding the organisation of the funeral and the nomination of a prime minister; the latter remains pending despite being required under a national transition agreement signed on 31 December, which fuels tension between the opposition and government. In addition to this, the location of his burial itself remains sensitive as the UDPS party had requested that Tshisekedi be buried near its headquarters in Limete district while his relatives initially agreed to a funeral in Gombe cemetery.</p>\n<p>Prior to his death, on 1 February in Brussels (Belgium) from a pulmonary embolism, Tshisekedi was heading a council to oversee the political transition until the next presidential election, tentatively due in late 2017. As such, his death complicates efforts to seek a negotiated solution to the political crisis resulting from the postponement of the presidential election due in late 2016.</p>\n<p>Former Katanga provincial governor Moise Katumbi, who lives in exile in Belgium, has previously stated that he would return to his country with Tshisekedi's remains, despite Congolese authorities rejecting this option. Though there is no indication that this information is confirmed, Katumbi is widely popular and his return would increase attendance at gatherings and the associated potential for unrest. In addition, Katumbi is charged with hiring foreign mercenaries - charges he claims are politically motivated - and faces arrest if he returns to Congo (DRC). Should he decide to return to the country, his plane will likely be barred from landing, while his arrival or arrest is likely to trigger significant outbreaks of unrest.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.internationalsos.com//~/media/dynamic-content/kinshasa-likely-gatherings-points-linked-to-tshisekedis-burial-02032017.png\"/></p>]]>"

This is a result of a growing presence of international drug-trafficking groups in the country, specifically due to infighting within such organisations over power vacuums created by a more concerted effort by the security forces to combat criminal leaders. However, the murder rate is still quite low in comparison to many other Central American countries, and foreign travellers are unlikely to be affected by drug-related violence, which is largely confined to drug traffickers and dealers, as well as security force personnel. </p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

It is transmitted by mosquitoes that bite at night, during the hours between dusk and dawn. Once a patient has been exposed to malaria, it can take as little as seven days or as long as one year to develop symptoms. These can be episodic and may include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhoea and jaundice. If not promptly treated, malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum can be rapidly fatal.</p>\n<p>For more information:</p> <ul> <li>See \"Malaria\" in the \"Diseases and Prevention\" dropdown on International SOS Country Guides</li> <li>See \"Preventing Mosquito Bites\" and \"Using Insect Repellents Safely\" in the \"Travel Advice\" dropdown on International SOS Country Guides</li> <li>See the International SOS Country Guide on Cuba</li> <li>Contact any International SOS assistance centre</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>The situation is evolving. </p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice for managers</b></p><p>If relevant to your employees or travellers, ensure they are aware of:</p>\n<ul> <li>Regional health threats including mosquito-borne diseases, who is most at risk and prevention strategies.</li> <li>Who to contact for advice and treatment if they get sick during or after travel.</li> <li>How to access bite prevention resources including insect repellents.</li>\n</ul>\nConsider:<br/>\n<ul> <li>Providing a travel health kit, including insect repellent.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.internationalsos.com//~/media/dynamic-content/alert-maps/jan17/cubamalaria.jpg\"/></p>]]>"

On 15 February, the president of the National Assembly (parliament) received a package containing a viable explosive device. A day later, a similar package was delivered to a journalist of a local television channel, while another suspected explosive device was discovered in the parking lot of a post office. The journalist received the package shortly after she had finished interviewing Lasso.</p>\nWhile none of the devices detonated, they prompted the evacuation of the affected area. The incidents, which took place on the last two days of the electoral campaign period, come amid ongoing political tensions related to the elections. Such incidents are unlikely to be directed at business travellers, and the primary impact of these would be localised disruption caused by police operations to secure an affected area in the aftermath of a bomb threat. Additional measures may include security checks and checkpoints near polling booths, which may cause some localised delays.<strong><br/>\n<br/>\n</strong></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>The presidential contest is particularly contentious as candidates vie not only to replace long-time President Rafael Correa (2007-present), but also to determine whether to persist with Correa's ruling-style in a successor or opt for broader change. A police officer was injured during confrontations between rival demonstrators on 19 and 20 February outside the CNE office in Guayaquil (Guayas province), while in Quito, supporters of Lasso, who were denouncing any potential electoral fraud after Moreno claimed he had won the election, disrupted traffic near the CNE office.</p>\n<p>Opponents and supporters of the top two candidates are likely to hold rallies in the run-up to the second round of elections. Such gatherings are most likely in cities including Quito, Guayaquil (Guayas province) and Cuenca (Azuay province); these will likely take place in main squares and in front of government buildings. Related marches may also be held occasionally on major thoroughfares, resulting in temporary travel disruption. Isolated clashes could also occur between participants and the police or between rival activists, posing incidental risks to bystanders.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

H5N1 infections are serious and can be fatal. Early treatment is critical. Most infections occur in people who have direct contact with poultry. There is no suspicion of the disease spreading in the general community. Overall, the risk of infection to travellers is low in those who avoid direct contact with birds (whether live or dead) and their droppings. Ensure all poultry for consumption is thoroughly cooked.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><p>Do the following:</p>\n<ul> <li>Avoid farms and \"wet markets\", where live animals may be present.</li> <li>Do not touch birds, even if they appear healthy. Ensure all poultry and eggs are thoroughly cooked.</li> <li>Do not eat raw products, such as raw duck blood.</li> <li>Wash your hands before and after preparing food, and before eating.</li> <li>Do not swim in any body of water that is used by birds.</li> <li>Consider having an influenza vaccination. Although it will not protect you against bird flu, it reduces your risk of a \"co-infection\" with human influenza. While in an affected area, monitor your health.</li> <li>If you develop flu-like symptoms (fever, cough, and fatigue) and have had exposure to birds, seek medical attention.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>The first cases of human infection with H5N1 bird flu for 2017 have been detected. Faiyum and Minya governorates are affected and at least one fatality has been recorded. Bird flu is consistently present in birds in Egypt, with frequent outbreaks in poultry and sporadic human cases. There is an ongoing risk to people in direct contact with live poultry.</p>\n<p>For more information:</p>\n<ul> <li>See \"Avian Influenza H5N1\" in the \"Diseases and Prevention\" dropdown on the International SOS Country Guides.</li> <li>See the Traveller Advice and Avian Flu pages on the International SOS Pandemic Information Website.</li> <li>About Egypt: see the International SOS Country Guide.</li> <li>Contact any International SOS assistance centre.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.internationalsos.com//~/media/dynamic-content/alert-maps/february-2017/egypt-h5n1-2017.jpg\"/></p>]]>"

The video, allegedly made shortly before the attack, called on militants to target Christians and 'liberate' Cairo. The release of the footage corresponds to an increase in attacks against Christians in El Arish, the most recent taking place on 23 February, when militants killed a local man in his home. Nearly 250 Christians have fled the violence and are being resettled by the government.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>Coptic Christians has long been a target for sectarian attacks by Islamist militants. The recent escalation of violence comes amid continued pressure from the security forces, who are engaged in a long-running counterinsurgency campaign in North Sinai.</p>\n<p>Although IS-affiliated militants have expressed a desire to expand their operations beyond Sinai, their efforts will likely continue to be contained by the Egyptian military. These latest incidents are also unlikely to indicate an increased capability or intent to target foreign Christians, as the majority of attacks will continue to target local the Coptic community.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Avoid all demonstrations as a precaution, to avoid incidental risks. In the event of unrest, leave the area immediately and remain in a safe location until the situation stabilises.</li> <li>Continue to expect heightened security, particularly in the capital Banjul and near government buildings. Comply with all official directives and carry the relevant identification documents to ease passage through security checkpoints or spot-checks. Treat security force personnel with patience and respect.</li> <li>Where appropriate for your nationality, register with your relevant embassy and all relevant warden networks.</li> <li>Monitor our alerts on Gambia to stay apprised of developments.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>Clashes broke out on 19 February between government and Jammeh supporters in the town of Kafenda (Western division), a stronghold of the former president. The government supporters were reportedly returning from Barrow's inauguration at the Independence Stadium in Bakau (Banjul division) the previous day when they were challenged by Jammeh supporters in Kafenda. Fifty-one people were arrested and additional police deployed to the town.</p>\n<p>Such developments highlight the remaining tensions after Jammeh (in office 1994-2017) stepped down under strong international pressure and went into exile. They also fuel concerns that Jammeh supporters could still destabilise the security situation. A member of the former presidential guard was arrested by Economic Community for West African States (ECOWAS) troops on 10 February for taking a weapon into the King Fahad Mosque in Banjul where Barrow was praying. This underlines the low, but continued risk of attacks by disgruntled Jammeh loyalists. </p>\n<p>The relaxation of restrictions on public gatherings and increased expectations of political reforms could see political unrest become a more regular feature of the future travel security environment.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>Barrow's official inauguration in Gambia on 18 February followed a lengthy political crisis triggered by former president Yahya Jammeh's refusal to concede defeat in the December 2016 presidential election. Barrow, who took an earlier oath of office in Senegal in January, is widely popular. However, his new administration faces several challenges, including the weakness of government institutions and the political inexperience of cabinet members after Jammeh's lengthy reign. Concerns will mainly centre on disgruntled military personnel, with any further high-profile reshuffles raising the risk of mutiny or coup attempts in the short-to-medium term. </p>\n<p>Legislative elections are scheduled for <strong>6 April</strong>, and further resistance by Jammeh supporters to the recent change in government is possible ahead of this. Nevertheless, the continued presence of 500 of the 4,000 ECOWAS troops deployed to Gambia in January during the earlier political crisis reduces the threat of major incidents. With the government placing a strong emphasis on national security, it has extended the ECOWAS mandate by three months until 21 May subject to renewal. ECOWAS troops on 30 January seized weapons at the State House in Banjul and in Jammeh's hometown of Kanilai (Western division).</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Those who are in Guinea-Bissau should protect themselves against mosquito bites and sexual transmission. After travel to the country, ongoing precautions against sexual transmission are recommended.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><p>Pregnant women, women trying to conceive and their partners are advised to discuss their risks with their doctor and consider postponing travel. Many health authorities advise pregnant women not to travel to areas with active transmission of Zika virus. In addition to the infectious risks of Guinea-Bissau, it is important to consider the standard of available healthcare, and the availability of obstetric and neonatal specialist support (should it be required).</p>\n<p>For those who will travel to, or are in Guinea-Bissau:</p>\n<ul> <li>Prevent infection by preventing mosquito bites: Use an effective insect repellent that contains DEET, Picaridin, PMD, or IR3535. When outdoors, wear clothing that covers most of your body (long sleeves, long pants, socks). Ensure windows are covered with fly-wire. Consider using an insecticide-treated bed net. Use \"knock-down\" insect spray to kill mosquitoes in your room. Choose air conditioned accommodation if possible.</li> <li>Prevent sexual transmission through the use of condoms (or abstinence).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After travel:</p>\n<ul> <li>Pregnant women - consult your doctor. You may be advised to be tested whether or not you develop symptoms. Your doctor may also arrange additional monitoring or specialist care.</li> <li>All travellers - monitor your health for two weeks. If you develop symptoms, ensure that you see a doctor and advise them of your travel history. This is especially important if you are, or are trying to fall pregnant. </li> <li>Prevent sexual transmission - Anyone who has a pregnant partner should use condoms (applicable to males and females) or abstain for the duration of the pregnancy. For those whose partners are not pregnant, authorities differ in their recommendations for the duration for which precautions should continue. <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/sexual-transmission-prevention/en/\" target=\"_blank\">The World Health Organization advises</a> that everyone should continue precautions for at least 6 months after return. <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/protect-yourself-during-sex.html\" target=\"_blank\">The United States CDC advises</a>: <strong>Men</strong> should continue precautions for at least 6 months; <strong>Women </strong>to continue precautions for at least 8 weeks. </li> <li>Consider delaying pregnancy - The World Health Organization <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/sexual-transmission-prevention/en/\" target=\"_blank\">recommends</a> couples or women planning a pregnancy, who have returned from an area with Zika transmission, to wait at least 6 months.

A subsequent investigation by health authorities in the Bijagos archipelago has confirmed at least seven more cases in August, as well as finding Zika virus in local mosquitoes. </p>\n<p>Cases of microcephaly have been reported from Oio and Gabu since April, however whether these are related to Zika virus has not yet been determined.</p>\n<p>Zika is a viral disease, mostly transmitted to people by mosquito bites. Zika virus can be passed from an infected pregnant mother to her baby. Spread through sexual contact (from men) occurs. Transmission via blood transfusion has occurred. Most people who have Zika infections do not have any symptoms. If symptoms occur, they are similar to chikunguyna or dengue, and include fever, rash, joint and muscle pains or conjunctivitis (red eyes), and typically last up to a week. The virus can cause severe irreversible birth defects, such as \"microcephaly\" (a small head with developmental abnormalities), and serious neurological complications. There is no specific treatment available, and no vaccine to prevent the disease.</p>\n<p>For more information:</p>\n<ul> <li>See the <a href=\"https://pandemic.internationalsos.com/zika\" target=\"_blank\">International SOS Zika website</a>.</li> <li>See \"Zika virus\" in the Diseases and Prevention dropdown on International SOS Country Guides.</li> <li>Contact any International SOS assistance centre.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>The virus is likely present in the local mosquito population and further human cases may occur.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice for managers</b></p><p>If relevant to your employees or travellers, ensure they are aware of:</p>\n<ul> <li>Regional health threats including Zika, who is most at risk (such as pregnant women), and prevention strategies. </li> <li>Who to contact for advice and treatment if they get sick during or after travel. </li> <li>How to access bite prevention resources including insect repellent and bed nets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consider:\n</p>\n<ul> <li>Providing a travel health kit, including insect repellent. </li> <li>Stipulating a medical pre-travel consultation.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.internationalsos.com//~/media/dynamic-content/alert-maps/july-2016/zika-guinea-bissau.jpg\"/></p>]]>"

The festival will be celebrated on <strong>13 March</strong> throughout the country, particularly in the northern and western states, including the capital Delhi. Members are advised to pre-arrange transport options and reconfirm bookings due to limited transport services during the festive period. Travellers should also exercise sensible safety precautions and have situational awareness during the festival. <br/></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><ul> <li>Allow additional time to complete journeys during the Holi festival period, pre-arrange transport and reconfirm them a few hours before the journey time as a precaution on the day.</li> <li>Due to the nature of the celebrations, members may prefer to remain indoors or, where practical, avoid lively crowds to avoid being targeted by revellers and take sensible security precautions against the risk of petty crime, particularly pickpocketing and bag-snatching. </li> <li>There is a credible risk of attack by militant separatist, Islamist extremist and communal groups. Potential targets include public transport; religious sites; busy, unsecured areas, such as marketplaces; government and military buildings and personnel; and venues where the Indian social elite and Westerners are known to congregate. Remain alert to your surroundings and report any suspicious activity or suspect packages to the police.</li> <li>Monitor our alerts on India for further updates.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>Revellers commonly throw coloured water and gulal (brightly coloured powder) at pedestrians as part of Holi celebrations. Moreover, incidents of drink-driving and rash driving, sexual harassment (locally known as 'eve-teasing') or applying gulal, and other forms of boisterous behaviour, are common during the festival. </p>\n<p><em>Travel disruption</em></p>\n<p>Public transport services in most cities will be limited on the day. There will also be a shortage of rental cars and taxis, including radio cabs. </p>\n<p><em>Terrorism</em></p>\n<p>Festival periods in the country are known flashpoints for terrorist groups due to large crowds and unrestricted public gatherings. In 2013, the authorities foiled a suspected plot to carry out attacks in Delhi during Holi, following the arrest of a Hizbul Mujahideen militant in Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh state), a few days before the festival. As such, increased security measures are likely at major public areas, including markets, tourist spots, religious sites and transport hubs, during this period. These measures could result in delays, particularly at transport hubs, where security checks are likely to be more elaborate than usual. </p>\n<p><em>Communal Unrest</em></p>\nThere is the potential for communal unrest during major festivals like Holi. However, this is likely to occur in smaller towns and villages, and in low-income neighbourhoods of major cities. <br/></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Travel to and within those states can continue during the election period. However, members should expect travel disruption from campaign events, and monitor developments for possible political violence. The final results will be announced simultaneously on <strong>11 March</strong>. The polling schedule is:</p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Uttar Pradesh</strong>: 4 and 8 March</li> <li><strong>Manipur</strong>: Two-phase polling on 4 and 8 March.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><ul> <li>Travel to and within Manipur and Uttar Pradesh can continue during the election period. However, campaign events can be expected to cause travel disruption, and members should consult local contacts for information on the locations of electoral campaigning, polling stations and protests venues, and plan routes bypassing such areas. Reconfirm the status of routes and allow plenty of time to complete journeys if the journey coincides with planned large campaign rallies.</li> <li>Members should also monitor developments because of potential for politically motivated violence. Seek professional security advice prior to visiting Manipur, which is rated as a HIGH travel risk destination.</li> <li>Avoid all gatherings as a standard security precaution, to mitigate the risk of incidental exposure to violence. Any attempt by the police to forcibly disperse protests is likely to prompt scuffles with demonstrators. Do not stop to watch or photograph demonstrators.</li> <li>Monitor our alerts on India for related developments.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p><em>Travel disruption</em></p>\n<p>Traffic disruption caused by campaigning activity will be the primary impact during the election period. Campaign rallies will increase in frequency as polling dates approach; however, campaigning officially comes to an end 36 hours prior to the start of voting. While most rallies have a localised impact, those held in major cities, such as the state capitals Imphal (Manipur) and Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh), typically attract thousands of attendees and cause significant traffic disruption. Major political parties' offices and public spaces such as parks, fields, stadiums and convention centres are usually popular gathering locations. In Manipur, the authorities have declared public holidays for 4 and 8 March. In addition, a daily curfew from 17.30 to 05.30 (local time) along the India-Myanmar border has been enforced <strong>until 11 March</strong>. </p>\n<p>Earlier polls in the states of Goa, Punjab and Uttarakhand since 4 February passed off peacefully and without major disruption. Other state elections due in 2017 include Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, which are expected towards the end of the year. </p>\n<p><em>Protest and politically motivated violence</em></p>\n<p>Demonstrations by rival groups of supporters are possible during the election cycle, as are protests over alleged electoral malpractices following adverse results by various groups. The most likely form of politically motivated violence to erupt will be low-level clashes between activists belonging to rival political parties. While foreign visitors are not a direct target of such activity, any violence poses incidental risks to bystanders.</p>\n<p>Moreover, insurgent groups in Manipur, where the travel risks are rated as HIGH, often attempt to subvert electoral processes with minor attacks and by calling for bandhs (shutdown strikes) during visits by senior leaders and/or on polling days. Several low-level attacks, including small explosions and shootings, on 2 and 3 March were reported outside political party offices and residences of electoral candidates. Heightened security measures, including checkpoints and spot-checks, have already been imposed due to an economic blockade in Manipur since December 2016; these are expected to be further tightened in the coming days. </p>\n<p><em>Communal violence</em></p>\n<p>There are additional risks from communal unrest between local Hindus and Muslims in Uttar Pradesh, where violence is more common during election periods. Various groups are known to spread rumours or engage in controversial actions in an attempt to polarise voters. Although related attacks target rival groups and mostly occur in rural areas, these can involve clashes in public places using sharp weapons, such as swords, and small arms. This would pose credible incidental risks to bystanders.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Plan itineraries, including accommodation and transport options, carefully.</li> <li>Female travellers should take enhanced precautions, such as avoiding poorly lit or isolated areas and travelling alone at night, carrying a mobile phone programmed with useful contacts at all times, dressing conservatively, avoiding ostentatious displays of wealth, being wary of unsolicited approaches by overly friendly strangers and guarding food and drinks in bars and nightclubs to avoid being drugged.</li> <li>In the event of being verbally harassed, do not reply to any comments; the best course of action is to swiftly leave the area and seek assistance from the police or a trusted local contact.</li> <li>Keep a trusted contact informed about local travel schedules and details of transport arrangements, particularly if travelling at night. Ensure that they can access the police in the event of an emergency.</li> <li>The above advice is not exhaustive. Consult the Standing Travel Advice and advice for businesswomen in India and monitor our alerts for more information.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>The same man is accused of assaulting a female Canadian national, a friend of the victim's, and had previously been arrested in 2015 for raping a female Russian national. Similarly, a man was arrested in December 2013 for allegedly raping a female German national at a yoga centre in a nearby village. Such incidents underline the risk of sexual assault against women, even in major cities and tourist areas. </p>\n<p>While rape and sexual assault are amongst the fastest growing crimes reported in India, the most common form of sexual harassment faced by foreign women is unwelcome verbal advances. Most sexual assaults in India are opportunistic rather than planned. The risks to female travellers can be significantly mitigated by adopting additional precautions, including avoiding accepting drinks from strangers or travelling alone after dark or in isolated locations.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Members should exercise caution at all times and report any suspicious activity or suspect packages to the authorities.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><ul> <li>Travel to India, including to and within major cities, can continue as normal. </li> <li>Remain alert to your surroundings at all times and report any suspicious activity or suspect packages to the authorities.</li> <li>Minimise time around potential targets in crowded and unsecured places, such as marketplaces, commercial centres and public transport hubs.</li> <li>Monitor our alerts on India for further updates.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>JeM has previously voiced resentment against Western organisations and corporations in South Asia. The recent anti-India rhetoric is likely driven by the country's support for a proposed UN ban on JeM leader Maulana Masood Azhar, a move that was blocked by China in February. While the group has shown the capability and intent to carry out attacks in the country in the past, the latest rhetoric does not highlight any increased threat to foreign nationals or interests in India. </p>\n<p>JeM's actions in recent years have been minor and mainly concentrated in the Kashmir region, primarily targeting government and security force infrastructure and personnel. Any related violence is usually small in scale, involving the use of homemade devices or readily available weapons. As such, there is a persistent threat of militant attacks in India, where several regional and domestic militant groups, such as the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) and the domestic Indian Mujahideen (IM), retain the intent and capability to conduct attacks.</p>\n<p>Crowded marketplaces and public transport, including the rapidly expanding metro services in several cities, remain prime militant targets because of their relatively lower levels of security. Places of worship are another key focus for militants seeking to foment communal tensions. While government and security buildings remain potential targets, and there are periodic official alerts indicating threats to aviation facilities and hotels, such facilities' heightened security measures are likely to provide some deterrence to militants.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Ahok secured 42.99% of the total votes polled, while Anies was placed second with 39.95% of ballots. Heightened political tensions are likely to persist ahead of the vote amid an ongoing blasphemy trial of Ahok, an ethnic-Chinese Christian, for allegedly insulting the Koran, the Islamic holy book. In addition to election-related gatherings, the campaign period for the 15 February polls was marked by anti-Ahok rallies by Islamist groups, most of which passed off peacefully.<br/>\n<p>However, such groups are likely to intensify their protests in the lead-up to the 19 April poll in an attempt to further increase religious tensions to drive Muslim supporters of the third-placed candidate, Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono (secured 17.05% of the total votes in the first round), to rally behind Anies. A stronger campaign rhetoric is likely also because of the small vote margin between Ahok and Anies in the first round of election and the fact that the incumbent governor secured the most votes despite the trial.</p>\n<p>As such, there is an increased risk of violence during protests ahead of the second round of election, though these are likely to be localised and swiftly contained by the security forces. Precedents suggest that campaign events and any anti-Ahok demonstrations are likely to be well attended, which, along with attendant security measures such as traffic restrictions and road closures, will cause localised traffic disruption in the capital.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

The aim of the operation is to capture the remaining MIT militants. Such operations are usually confined to rural areas, limiting their impact on business travellers, though additional checkpoints and patrols are also likely in urban centres to mitigate possible retaliatory attacks.\n<p>Over the past year, the security forces have arrested or killed at least 33 militants, including MIT leader Santoso, who was killed in July 2016. Most recently, on 31 December 2016, the National Police's counter-terrorism unit, Densus 88, arrested one suspected militant. The suspect was allegedly planning to carry out attacks during New Year's eve celebrations in different areas of the city of Palu (Central Sulawesi), including at churches and Shia Muslim religious places.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p>While the security operation has achieved notable success, there remains a persistent threat from extremist groups in Indonesia, some of which have ties with transnational organisations, such as the extremist Islamic State (IS) group, and share their ideology. However, it is unlikely that these links have significantly altered the capability of domestic militants to carry out attacks. Thus far, IS influence is currently limited to personal rather than organisational links with local affiliates, most likely facilitated by Indonesians who have interacted with foreign militants in the Middle East.\n<p>The primary targets of domestic militants continue to be the military, police and religious minorities. However, there are indications that local militants may attempt to replicate a pattern set by international jihadist groups, in which attacks are mounted against low-security areas, marketplaces, commercial districts, bars, and restaurants as well as transport hubs to maximise casualties. While any such incident is likely to be poorly planned because of the limited access to training, funds, and logistics support, even poorly trained militants with crude weapons can execute high-impact attacks, posing significant direct and indirect risks to travellers.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Court sessions are often held at the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/78nptr\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Agriculture</a> complex in the Ragunan area (South Jakarta); while the timing is unclear, previous such hearings have occurred on Tuesdays at <strong>09.00</strong> (local time). Precedents indicate that large crowds of Ahok's supporters and opponents are likely to congregate near the complex. A heightened security presence can be expected on hearing dates, causing traffic congestion in the area (see map).</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><ul> <li>Travel to Jakarta can continue. Continue to monitor developments and expect demonstrations in the vicinity of the agriculture ministry on hearing days. Avoid all rallies and large public gatherings as a precaution.</li> <li>If planning travel near the agriculture ministry complex during scheduled hearing dates, maintain flexible itineraries and allow additional time to complete journeys. Comply with all official directives.</li> <li>Be vigilant at all times. Report any suspicious behaviour or suspect packages to the authorities.</li> <li>Monitor our alerts on Indonesia for further updates.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>Hearings can be expected to continue in the coming weeks, as it remains unclear when the verdict for the trial will be reached. There have been occasions during previous hearings, including on 13 February, when witnesses failed to appear to give their statements, leading to adjournments. </p>\n<p>The security force presence in the vicinity of the trial venue is likely to remain high due to precedents of the hardline Islamist group Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) holding large-scale rallies against Ahok for alleged blasphemy. The court is likely to restrict the number of spectators present at the hearings and conduct security checks on those entering the agriculture ministry building. Roads outside the complex will therefore be the main focus of any protests. Short-notice or partial closures of Jalan RM Harsono and nearby Jalan TB Simatupang are possible on hearing dates. While most demonstrations have passed off without incident, low-level scuffles between rival groups were reported during hearings on 3 January and 10 January. </p>\n<p><em>Security concerns</em> </p>\n<p>The North Jakarta district court was the venue for court hearings in December 2016, but they were moved to the agriculture ministry in January, primarily because it has a lower profile and is located further away from the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/Vb6LC5X1ya62\" target=\"_blank\">Istana Merdeka</a> (presidential palace). This means that the presidential palace and nearby sensitive government institutions are unlikely to be affected by spillover violence if protests become unruly. </p>\n<p> Many of the shops near the North Jakarta district court also have local ethnic-Chinese owners. Minor episodes of vandalism and the looting of several local ethnic-Chinese-owned shops were reported on 4 November 2016 during a large anti-Ahok rally outside the presidential palace. Although the police said that the incidents were unrelated, the development reflects the underlying potential for racial and religious tensions to prompt unrest. However, incidents targeting Chinese expatriates or travellers, including low-level verbal harassment or physical assaults, remain highly unlikely.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>Ahok, an ethnic-Chinese Christian, stands accused of insulting the Koran, the Islamic holy book, during a speech to prospective voters in late September 2016. Although he has apologised for causing offence, official investigations into the allegations against him have continued. Opposition to Ahok, who is campaigning for a second term in the current gubernatorial election, is most likely driven by politics rather than religious tensions.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.internationalsos.com//~/media/dynamic-content/tsalertmaps/2017/february/indonesia-jakarta-28-february-trial-protest-20170224.jpg\"/></p>]]>"

Members should not be alarmed by a heightened police presence around potential militant targets in the city. Security force personnel and infrastructure, such as checkpoints and convoys, are the principal targets of attacks; however, churches, marketplaces, commercial districts, bars, restaurants and transport hubs are also vulnerable.</li> <li>Remain vigilant and immediately report suspicious behaviour or suspect packages to the authorities.</li> <li>Follow all directives issued by the authorities.</li> <li>Monitor our alerts on Indonesia for notable developments.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>According to the police, the suspect was a member of the local hardline Islamist militant group Jamaah Anshar Daulah (JAD), also known as Jammah Anshar Daulah Khilafah Nusantara (JAKDN), which has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) extremist group. The suspect, with the aid of an accomplice, carried out the attack to force the National Police's counter-terrorism unit, Densus 88, to release imprisoned militants. The accomplice is still at large. </p>\n<p>The authorities can be expected to increase security around potential militant targets and carry out further security operations in the coming days. Domestic militant groups primarily target the military, the police and religious minorities. Any militant attacks are likely to be carried out by small, decentralised networks and typically involve the use of crude bombs or rudimentary weapons such as knives and small firearms. Although such attacks are likely to be poorly executed because of perpetrators' limited access to training, funds and logistical support, they can have major impact, posing significant direct and indirect risks to travellers.</p>\n<p>Islamist militants in Indonesia have shown growing intent to carry out high-impact and high-profile strikes against soft targets such as shopping centres, entertainment venues, open-air tourist sites, commercial and entertainment districts and public transport hubs. It is difficult for the authorities to detect and prevent one-off and small-scale attacks against lower-security soft targets where foreigners congregate, such as bars and restaurants; as such, members should exercise situational awareness at all times in these venues.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

It is suspected that opportunistic criminal elements among the herders have been responsible for cattle rustling, arson attacks and poaching. Such incidents are likely to remain confined to property in remote rural regions away from urban centres and recent security improvements and the recent eviction of herders from ranches are likely to partially limit associated risks.</p>\n<p>A prolonged period of drought has exacerbated unrest among herders, who have sought new grazing land for their cattle. In addition, it is suspected that local politicians have stoked historic tensions over land between herders and private investors in the Rift Valley in an attempt to boost electoral support in the lead-up to the upcoming August elections. Tensions are likely to remain elevated in the coming months, potentially triggering security incidents in other previously unaffected areas.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

There have been at least two fatalities in Nimba. Over 100 contacts have been identified and will undergo a 21 day observation period.</p>\n<p>Outbreaks of Lassa fever are common in Liberia and occur annually with highest incidence in Lofa, Nimba and Grand Cape Mount.

In some areas of Liberia, approximately 15% of people admitted to hospitals every year have Lassa fever.</p>\n<p>\nWhat is Lassa Fever? </p>\n<p>Lassa virus is most common in West African countries. Rodents, particularly rats, carry the disease. People usually become infected by inhaling dried rodent excretions, eating food contaminated by rodent excrement, or eating infected rodents. Outbreaks occur when people unprotected contact with bodily fluids from an infected person, which can occur in households and in healthcare facilities. Symptoms commonly include fever, joint and back pain, sore throat, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. The disease causes severe illness in about 20 percent of those who contract it and it can be fatal, especially if treatment is delayed or unavailable. Severe Lassa fever is characterized by bleeding from the nose, mouth, gastrointestinal tract and vagina. The antiviral drug ribavirin may save a patient's life if given soon after infection. This drug is sometimes used as a preventative measure for people who have had extremely high-risk exposure to the Lassa virus. Prevention is through avoiding contact with rodents and their excretions, ensuring food and water are hygienically prepared, and using strict infection control practices when caring for sick people. </p>\n<p>For More Information: </p>\n<ul> <li>See \"Lassa Fever\" in the \"Diseases and Prevention\" dropdown.</li> <li>See Travel Advice Articles \"Selecting Safe Food and Water\" on the International SOS Country Guide.</li> <li>See the Travel Advice article \"Rodents spread diseases\" on the International SOS Country Guides.</li> <li>About Liberia: see the International SOS Country Guide. </li> <li>Contact any International SOS assistance centre.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.internationalsos.com//~/media/dynamic-content/alert-maps/february-2017/liberia_lassa_07feb2017.jpg\"/></p>]]>"

Investigation in neighbouring villages is underway. Health authorities, with assistance from the World Health Organization, have stepped up measures to contain the spread of disease.</p>\n<p>The disease is considered endemic in parts of Madagascar. Cases are frequently reported, particularly during the rainy season.</p>\n<p>What is Plague?</p>\n<p>Plague is found in many areas of the world. It is caused by the bacterium <em>Yersinia pestis</em> and mainly affects rodents. It is occasionally transmitted to humans when they are bitten by fleas carrying the bacteria, or more rarely via contact with an infected animal or person. There are three main forms of plague in humans: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic.</p>\n<p>Bubonic plague is the more common form and occurs as the result of a flea bite. The plague bacteria travel through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node. That lymph node becomes enlarged and tender, forming a \"bubo\".</p>\n<p>The septicaemic form of plague occurs when the infection spreads in the bloodstream. Without antibiotic treatment, this form of plague is usually fatal.</p>\n<p>Pneumonic plague occurs when <em>Y. pestis</em> infects the lungs. The first signs of pneumonic plague are fever, headache, weakness and cough that produces bloody or watery sputum. The pneumonia progresses over two to four days and may cause septic shock and, without early treatment, death. This form of plague can move from person to person, if someone has close contact with a plague patient. The sick person coughs out infectious respiratory droplets which can spread the bacteria to others. People who have had face-to-face contact with a pneumonic plague patient are given prophylactic (preventative) antibiotic treatment.\n</p>\n<p>For more information:\n</p>\n<ul> <li>About plague: See \"Plague\" in the \"Diseases and Prevention\" dropdown on the International SOS Country Guides. </li> <li>About insect repellent: see the Travel Advice Article \"Using Insect Repellents Safely\" on the International SOS Country Guides. </li> <li>About the Madagascar: see the International SOS Country Guide. </li> <li>Contact any International SOS assistance center.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>The outbreak is occurring in remote areas and risk of infection to travellers is low.

In addition, there are signs of growing links between local sympathisers and a wider international militant network, as indicated by the diverse nationalities of the suspects arrested so far. </p>\n<p>Several of those detained in recent months are believed to have ties with Mohamad Wanndy Mohamad Jedi, a Syria-based IS militant from Malaysia who helps fund and recruit militants in his home country. Wanndy is thought to be the mastermind behind the 28 June 2016 grenade explosion in a bar in Puchong Jaya (Selangor) – the first successful IS-inspired attack in the country. The police said that at least two of the latest detainees had been taking orders from Wanndy and planning to carry out attacks in Malaysia before leaving for Syria to join IS.</p>\n<p>Although the authorities have robust counter-terrorism capabilities, attacks involving minimal planning are likely to be difficult to prevent, as underlined by the attack in Puchong Jaya. The most likely targets for militant attacks are areas deemed haram (forbidden) for violating Islamic principles; these include red-light areas, bars, breweries, non-Muslim religious sites and restaurants that serve alcohol in central business districts of major urban centres, including those frequented by foreigners.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Those who are in affected areas should protect themselves against mosquito bites and sexual transmission. After travel, ongoing precautions against sexual transmission are recommended. </p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><p>Pregnant women, women trying to conceive and their partners are advised to discuss their risks with their doctor and consider postponing travel to any area where Zika virus transmission is ongoing. In addition to the infectious risks of any destination, it is important to consider the standard of available healthcare, and the availability of obstetric and neonatal specialist support (should it be required).Pregnant women - discuss your risks with your doctor, including whether you should postpone travel.</p>\n<p>For those who will travel to, or are in Malaysia:</p>\n<ul> <li>Prevent infection by preventing mosquito bites: Use an effective insect repellent that contains DEET, Picaridin, PMD, or IR3535. When outdoors, wear clothing that covers most of your body (long sleeves, long pants, socks). Ensure windows are covered with fly-wire. Consider using an insecticide-treated bed net. Use \"knock-down\" insect spray to kill mosquitoes in your room. Choose air conditioned accommodation if possible. </li> <li>Prevent sexual transmission through the use of condoms (or abstinence). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nAfter travel: </p>\n<ul> <li>Pregnant women - Consult your doctor. You may be advised to be tested for Zika whether or not you develop symptoms. Your doctor may also arrange additional monitoring or specialist care. </li> <li>All travellers - Monitor your health for two weeks. If you develop symptoms, ensure that you see a doctor and advise them of your travel history. This is especially important if you are, or are trying to fall pregnant. </li> <li>Prevent sexual transmission - Anyone who has a pregnant partner should use condoms (applicable to males and females) or abstain for the duration of the pregnancy. For those whose partners are not pregnant, authorities differ in their recommendations for the duration for which precautions should continue. <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/sexual-transmission-prevention/en/\" target=\"_blank\">The World Health Organization advises</a> that<strong> everyone</strong> should continue precautions for at least 6 months after return. <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/protect-yourself-during-sex.html\" target=\"_blank\">The United States CDC advises</a>: <strong>Men</strong> should continue precautions for at least 6 months; <strong>Women</strong> should continue precautions for at least 8 weeks. </li> <li>Consider delaying pregnancy - The World Health Organization <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/sexual-transmission-prevention/en/\" target=\"_blank\">recommends</a> couples or women planning a pregnancy, who have returned from an area with Zika transmission, to wait at least 6 months. The United States CDC <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/pregnancy/women-and-their-partners.html\" target=\"_blank\">recommend</a> women trying to get pregnant wait at least 8 weeks and partners of women trying to get pregnant wait at least 6 months.</li> <li>Prevent transmission to local mosquitoes. If you are returning to an area that has mosquitoes which can transmit Zika, continue to prevent mosquito bites for 2 to 3 weeks (e.g. using insect repellent). This will reduce the risk of infecting local mosquitoes with Zika, and therefore reduce the risk of an outbreak.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>Since the beginning of September there have been at least eight confirmed cases of Zika, including an imported case from Singapore. Testing on five of the Zika patients indicate that the virus contracted locally is from the \"Asian lineage\". Two cases, including the imported case, are similar to the post-2007 strain, currently circulating in French Polynesia since 2013. The other three cases are from the older “Asian” lineage which has been previously circulating in Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>Zika may have been present in mosquitoes in Malaysia for some time. A report <a href=\"http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/5/14-1960_article\" target=\"_blank\">published in May 2015</a> confirms Zika infection in a traveller who visited Sabah and peninsular Malaysia in 2014.</p>\n<p>What is Zika?</p>\n<p>Zika is a viral disease, mostly transmitted to people by mosquito bites. Zika virus can be passed from an infected pregnant mother to her baby. Spread through sexual contact occurs. Transmission via blood transfusion has been reported. Most people who have Zika infections do not have any symptoms. If symptoms occur, they are similar to chikungunya or dengue, and include fever, rash, joint and muscle pains or conjunctivitis (red eyes), and typically last up to a week. The virus can cause severe irreversible birth defects, such as \"microcephaly\" (a small head with developmental abnormalities), and serious neurological complications. There is no specific treatment available, and no vaccine to prevent the disease.</p>\n<p>For more information:</p>\n<ul> <li>See the <a href=\"http://pandemic.internationalsos.com/zika\" target=\"_blank\">International SOS Zika website</a>. </li> <li>See the International SOS Country Guide on Malaysia.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>The situation is continuing to evolve. The geographic spread within Malaysia, and transmission intensity is uncertain. An increase in cases is likely as screening and testing is increased. Further cases may be sporadic in nature, however an outbreak with high case numbers and rapid growth might occur.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

No group has yet claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, which underlines the need to adopt stringent precautions in border areas.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><ul> <li>Members undertaking travel to border areas of Sikasso region should adopt enhanced security precautions. This should include liaising with local officials and embassies, as well as robust journey management planning and obtaining itinerary-specific advice prior to any travel. </li> <li>Avoid all travel to the northern desert regions of Gao, Kidal and Timbuktu, as well as to areas of Mopti region located north of Mopti city and Segou region north of Segou city, due to the risks associated with Islamist militancy. </li> <li>Vary routines as a security precaution. Try to change itineraries and timings for regular journeys. </li> <li>Liaise with local contacts and monitor our travel security alerts for Mali for further developments.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>The kidnap illustrates the deterioration of the security environment in eastern Mali and follows the abductions of a French NGO worker in Gao region (December 2016) and a Swiss national in Timbuktu (December 2015). Jihadist activity in those areas informs their EXTREME travel risk ratings. Sikasso region carries a MEDIUM travel risk rating, as militant operations there have hitherto been infrequent.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, northern Sikasso, where Karangasso is located, borders both Mopti region – where Islamist militant activity has increased over the past year, and the travel risks are HIGH – and Burkina Faso. Proximity to a porous international frontier can also facilitate kidnappers' access and escape.</p>\n<p>The increased militant presence in Segou and Mopti regions means that the reach of such groups has potentially expanded further south, posing increased risks of hit-and-run attacks in north-eastern parts of Sikasso. The development has already translated into a series of security incidents in northern Segou and in Mopti, including numerous attacks on security force personnel.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>Sikasso experienced some militant activity in mid-2015 – including an attack on Misséni in June – but no further incidents occurred after military operations in the area, near the border with Côte d'Ivoire, were carried out. However, Malian forces lack the capabilities to effectively counter militancy, especially in remote, sparsely populated and poorly policed eastern and northern areas.</p> <p>Mali, Burkina Faso, Chad, Mauritania and Niger earlier in February said that they would create a joint counter-terrorism force, though no further details were provided. The UN Mission for the Stabilization of Mali (MINUSMA) comprises 12,000 troops, while 3,000 French soldiers are also deployed across the region. Nevertheless, efforts to eradicate jihadist activity in northern desert regions have been hampered by lawlessness, conflict, instability in Libya and continued smuggling of weapons across the Sahel.</p> </p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the armed opposition movement Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo), announced the extension on 3 March to allow further peace talks with President Filipe Nyusi's government. The original ceasefire has been extended multiple times to accommodate dialogue with the government. Despite this positive development, some insurgent-led violence is likely to continue.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><ul> <li>Travel to Mozambique can continue with standard security precautions.</li> <li>Avoid all non-essential travel to rural areas of Sofala, Manica, Zambezia provinces because of the increased risks posed there by insurgent activity.</li> <li>Road movement in these areas should be for business-critical purposes only and should be conducted with experienced local drivers, a strict communications regime and security support. Members can continue to fly to or between urban centres, including provincial capitals, without additional precautions.</li> <li>Members intending to conduct business-critical road journeys should contact their nearest Assistance Centre for an up-to-date assessment and itinerary-specific advice. Expect delays along routes due to enforced convoy procedures on certain highways.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>Amid an increase in violence in 2016, talks between Renamo and the government resumed in July; this was the first time the two parties had negotiated since August 2015. Incidents have been reported in at least six central and northern provinces, where Renamo frequently targeted commercial and private vehicles. After a spate of attacks on vehicles, the authorities introduced mandatory security force convoys along EN1 highway in Sofala in February 2016. Similar requirements were introduced along the EN7 highway in Manica in June.</p>\n<p>However, the convoys were mostly ineffective in deterring the attacks. A civilian bus under military escort on 12 December was attacked along the EN7 in Barue district (Manica province), where days prior at least two other attacks were reported. The same week, vehicles transporting a group of foreign nationals were attacked on the road between the EN1 and Inhamitanga (Sofala province). Renamo also started targeting state-owned property in remote villages, such as health centres, police stations and government offices. Violence linked to the Renamo insurgency continues to pose direct and indirect risks to travellers.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

The CPN-UML, which has long had tense relations with ethnic-Madhesi groups, had launched a 15-day political campaign on 4 March to oppose a controversial constitutional amendment bill (<em>see our separate report</em>).

Demonstrators set fire to a vehicle at a Nepalgunj (Banke district) market for allegedly breaking the bandh and have attempted to disrupt the Gulariya-Nepalganj Highway.

Members should expect continuing heightened security measures, including regular road patrols, particularly between <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/XKLr7ZKDgFE2\" target=\"_blank\">Saint-Louis</a> and <a href=\"https://goo.gl/VEsFLH\" target=\"_blank\">Mont-Dore commune</a> (South). Tensions between the authorities and local community remain unresolved; all official directives should be followed.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><ul> <li>Travel to New Caledonia can continue. Liaise with trusted local contacts to ascertain the safety of routes in South province prior to undertaking road travel. Maintain flexible itineraries and allow additional time for journeys.</li> <li>Continue to anticipate heightened security along the RP1, particularly between Saint-Louis and Mont-Dore. Comply with all official directives at all times. Carry relevant identification documents to ease passage through checkpoints.</li> <li>Do not attempt to cross any roadblocks as this may provoke a hostile reaction. If you encounter a roadblock, turn around and seek another route to your destination.</li> <li>Monitor our alerts on New Caledonia (France) for further updates.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>Previously, security along the nearby RP1 at Saint-Louis was heightened following clashes between the security forces and armed men from the indigenous Kanak group on 27 January. A temporary curfew prohibiting night-time travel was in place from 30 January-6 February. Motorists and police officers have intermittently been attacked along RP1 near Mont-Dore. Locals were angered by a fatal police shooting of an indigenous man who escaped from prison on 29 October, organising rallies to protest the shooting afterwards.</p>\n<p>Despite an agreement between the authorities and local community leaders on 2 November 2016 over the issue, intermittent security incidents have continued. Local residents have also staged sporadic demonstrations in Mont-Dore since November 2016 to express frustration at the government over the continued violence and disruption. Around 2,000 people rallied outside the French High Commission on 3 February. Additional disturbances have also been reported along the RT1 route that connects Noumea to Tontouta International Airport (<a href=\"https://goo.gl/vLnlph\" target=\"_blank\">NOU</a>).</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>The October 2016 fatal shooting incident occurred two days after 5,000 people in Noumea joined a demonstration organised by Kanak activists advocating for the independence of New Caledonia from France, as stipulated in the Noumea Accord of 1998. The event was also held to condemn alleged electoral fraud by the French government. The ongoing tension over the two issues is likely to spark further rallies in the coming months, during which a heightened security presence should be expected in Mont-Dore.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Members are reminded of the need to avoid all journeys to the HIGH travel risk areas within 100 miles (160km) of the Malian border.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><ul> <li>Avoid all journeys to HIGH travel risk areas within 100 miles (160km) of the border with Mali, because of the risks posed by militant activity. Travel to the northern region should be for essential purposes only and requires stringent security measures. </li> <li>Members travelling to rural areas north of the capital Niamey and within 125 miles (200km) of the Malian border should adopt stringent security precautions. </li> <li>There is a credible risk of terrorist attacks by Islamist extremists in Niger. Where possible, minimise time spent in the vicinity of potential targets for militant attacks, including embassies, government and security force assets and entertainment venues where Westerners are known to congregate. </li> <li>If undertaking business-critical travel outside major urban areas, register with your embassy and all relevant warden networks and ensure you have comprehensive security and journey management planning in place beforehand, as well as a secure escort. Government escorts are highly recommended for overland travel outside Niamey. </li> <li>The above advice is not exhaustive; seek itinerary-specific advice prior to travel to Niger.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>Reports indicate that the attack was eventually repelled by the military, prompting the assailants to retreat towards the Malian border. Additional security force personnel and aircraft were deployed during follow-up security operations. Although no group has claimed responsibility for the attack, Islamist militants based in Mali are the most likely perpetrators. The incident follows a recent wave of raids on security posts by gunmen in desert areas in or bordering Mali. In particular, a Mali-based group affiliated to the extremist Islamic State (IS) movement has been blamed for previous incidents.</p>\n<p>The 3 March state of emergency applies in Abala, Ayorou, Banibangou, Bankilare and Ouallam departments (all Tillaberi), as well as Tassara and Tilia (both Tahoua region). The measure grants the security forces additional powers, including the ability to conduct house searches at any time. However, despite international efforts to support counter-terrorism operations, Niger's security forces are overstretched and lack the capability to effectively counter militancy and banditry in remote areas.</p> </p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>The latest incident underlines the continued potential for militant incursions and cross-border attacks in areas near the Malian border, justifying the region's HIGH travel risk rating. The recent emergence of IS in the Sahel is a particular cause for concern amid an increase in Islamist extremist activity linked to several factors, including setbacks experienced by IS' Libyan branch in Sirte (Libya). Niger borders Libya to the north and is exposed to infiltration by militants using the Sahel's traditional trafficking corridors in southern Libya and northern Niger.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

However, flights to Murtala Muhammed International Airport (<a href=\"http://lagosairport.net/\" target=\"_blank\">LOS</a>) in Lagos (Lagos state) and Port Harcourt International Airport (PHC, Rivers state) will be maintained. Several domestic airlines such as Arik Air, Med-View and Air Peace have announced that they would increase the number of daily flights between Kaduna and Lagos during this period. Separately, reports indicate that helicopter shuttle transfers will also be available during daylight hours between Abuja and Minna Airport (MXJ, Niger state), 100 miles (160km) north-west of the capital.</p>\n<p>The authorities have said they would provide secure transport by shuttle bus between Abuja and Kaduna, and deploy additional security personnel at Kaduna Airport and along the A2 highway to protect travellers. Robberies, kidnappings and other criminal activity on the A2 highway linking the two cities, as shown by the 22 February abduction of two German archaeologists (<em>see our dedicated report</em>), mean that members need to have a security escort, whether privately arranged or state-provided.</p>\nThe runway upgrade was prompted by safety concerns expressed by international airlines. The airport closure is tentatively scheduled to last for six weeks, though the work may last longer than planned. The rerouting of flights is expected to entail some disruption to schedules, as well as requiring extra road travel between Kaduna and Abuja. Reduced options mean that any available flights to Kaduna – whether international or domestic – are likely to be in unusually high demand by passengers seeking to reach Abuja.<br/></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Avoid direct unprotected contact with sick people and their body fluids. Avoid environments contaminated by rodents. Select safe food and water.</li> <li>If you do need to seek medical care for any reason, call International SOS and we will direct you to an appropriate facility.</li> </ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>Since December 2016, there have been over 60 confirmed cases of Lassa fever, including more than 35 deaths. Twelve states have reported cases: Bauchi, Borno, Cross River, Ebonyi, Edo, Kaduna, Nasarawa, Ogun, Ondo, Plateau, Rivers and Taraba. The Nigerian Centre of Disease Control (NCDC) is assisting the affected states in their response activities. The Ministry of Health has implemented a rapid response, raising awareness in healthcare workers to use appropriate infection control procedures, test before treating for malaria, and have a high index of suspicion especially if malaria tests are negative. </p>\n<p>Lassa fever is persistently present in Nigeria, and outbreaks are not uncommon.</p>\n<p>What is Lassa Fever?\n</p>\n<p>Lassa virus is most common in West African countries. Rodents, particularly rats, carry the disease. People usually become infected by inhaling dried rodent excretions, eating food contaminated by rodent excrement, or eating infected rodents. Outbreaks occur when people unprotected contact with bodily fluids from an infected person, which can occur in households and in healthcare facilities. Symptoms commonly include fever, joint and back pain, sore throat, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. The disease causes severe illness in about 20 percent of those who contract it and it can be fatal, especially if treatment is delayed or unavailable. Severe Lassa fever is characterized by bleeding from the nose, mouth, gastrointestinal tract and vagina. The antiviral drug ribavirin may save a patient's life if given soon after infection. This drug is sometimes used as a preventative measure for people who have had extremely high-risk exposure to the Lassa virus.\nPrevention is through avoiding contact with rodents and their excretions, ensuring food and water are hygienically prepared, and using strict infection control practices when caring for sick people.</p>\n<p>For More Information:</p>\n<ul> <li>See \"Lassa Fever\" in the \"Diseases and Prevention\" dropdown on the International SOS Country Guides.</li> <li>About Nigeria: see the International SOS Country Guide.</li> <li>Contact any International SOS assistance centre.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>Further cases may be identified.

Use of well-established tour companies is essential.</li> <li>Travel arrangements should be carefully checked before commencing journeys to North Korea to ensure that any government restrictions do not disrupt travel. These routinely change without notice. </li> <li>As well as the specific restrictions, in-country travellers should ensure they are fully aware of the additional sensitivities in North Korea. This includes avoidance of reference to South Korea and discussing sensitive issues, and respect for the regime. </li> <li>Members in the country are advised to take active measures to ensure their profile minimises the attraction of suspicion or attention. These include:</li> <ul> <li>Avoiding discussion of political subjects, particularly those in relation to South Korea.</li> <li>Minimise the carriage of electronic items into North Korea, particularly mobile telephones and laptops. Where laptops are taken, all files or references to sensitive subjects should be removed, including references to South Korea.

Reports claim that 11 Malaysian nationals – three embassy staff, six of their family members and two UN workers – were recently prevented from leaving the country at the capital's Pyongyang International Airport (FNJ). Government restrictions on travel routinely change without notice in North Korea, and are sensitive to diplomatic tensions.</p>\n<p>While in North Korea, there are limited means of communication outside the country, and few avenues of recourse should foreigners encounter legal or other problems. Moreover, foreigners are vulnerable to arbitrary detention by the authorities and subject to significant government scrutiny, including monitoring of all communications and conversations. The government is also known to regularly restrict the movement of foreigners within the country at short notice.</p>\n<p><em>Background</em></p>\n<p>While investigations into Kim Jong-nam's assassination are ongoing, North Korea is widely suspected of orchestrating the 13 February killing, which occurred at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KUL, Malaysia). However, North Korea has not confirmed the identity of the victim and denies any involvement in the incident. The Malaysian police have arrested two women – one a Vietnamese national, the other Indonesian – and are looking for four North Korean suspects, two of whom are believed to be hiding at their country's embassy in Kuala Lumpur.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Minimise exposure to more likely targets including the lobby, car park and entrance.</li> <li>Anticipate increased scrutiny, including additional police patrols and spot-checks. Comply promptly with all instructions issued by the security forces and carry personal identification documents to facilitate movement through checkpoints.</li> <li>Monitor our alerts on Pakistan for further developments.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p><em>Security measures</em></p>\n<p>Following reports of the threat of a suicide attack in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, the authorities have issued a high alert around important buildings, hospitals and schools. In Islamabad, security measures have been increased in Sectors F-6, F-7, F-10, G-6 as well as the Blue Area, the main commercial hub, and the Red Zone, where government buildings, the diplomatic enclave, as well as upscale business-class hotels used by international travellers and the Pakistani elite are located. </p>\n<p>However, International SOS and Control Risks have confirmed with their team in Islamabad that, contrary to some rumours on social media, no curfew has been imposed in the capital and the police have not issued advice to avoid any specific sites in the city. </p>\n<p>Stringent security measures and increased security checks can be expected around potential militant targets in major cities and key routes around the country. The Sindh provincial authorities on 23 February also issued an alert, warning that key public places in Karachi might be targets, including the Sindh High Court, Sindh Assembly, Empress Market, Zainab Market, markets at MA Jinnah Road and restaurants at Do Darya in DHA along Sea View Road. In Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces, the law enforcement agencies have established joint check posts on motorways of <a href=\"https://goo.gl/YXnBQr\" target=\"_blank\">M1</a> (connecting Peshawar to Rawalpindi - Islamabad) and <a href=\"https://goo.gl/TRj6Pk\" target=\"_blank\">M2</a> (linking Lahore to Rawalpindi - Islamabad).</p>\n<p>In addition, the authorities on 16 February closed the Torkham border crossing with Afghanistan. Frequent counter-terrorism operations can also be expected by the security forces; around 30 militants have been killed in such raids across the country in recent days. However, these raids are part of routine operations and do not indicate an increased threat from terrorism. </p>\n<p><em>Security concerns</em></p>\n<p>Several alerts were circulated through various social media platforms on 15 February stating planned militant attacks in major cities, with plots to target the Blue Area and F-11 Markaz in Islamabad; Main Market, Mall Road, cantonment area, Fortress and DHA markets in Lahore; and Dolmen Mall and a hotel in Karachi. However, the authorities subsequently confirmed that the alerts were hoaxes. </p>\n<p>Nonetheless, there is a credible risk of terrorist attacks in Pakistan. Militants continue to primarily focus on security force and government infrastructure and personnel as well as religious facilities associated with minorities. However, militants remain active in major urban centres and have shown a willingness to carry out attacks against soft targets such as marketplaces, parks, and other areas that have minimal security and a large number of individuals gathered. Attacks against high security facilities such as business class hotels, international schools and embassies, while impossible to rule out, remain significantly less likely. </p>\n<p>Several militant groups maintain recruiting and operational cells in the country, including the Islamist Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP, the Pakistani Taliban), Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ), as well as the international terrorist network al-Qaida. The extremist Islamic State (IS) group's claim of responsibility for the large bombing on 16 February in Sehwan Sharif (Sindh) underlines the Middle-East based terrorist group's increasing operational capabilities in Pakistan; while IS is not known to have a strong presence in the country, a number of defectors from domestic groups have been known to pledge allegiance to the group. Given the country's entrenched terrorist network, the risk of further successful militant attacks will persist in Pakistan.</p>\n<p>Details of major attacks over the past week are as follows:</p>\n<ul> <li>16 February: A suicide bombing at the Lal Shahbaz Qalandar Sufi Muslim shrine in Sehwan Sharif killed at least 75 people and injured more than 200 others. </li> <li>15 February: A suicide attack outside the Peshawar Development Authority (PDA) office in the Hayatabad area of Peshawar killed at least two person and injuring four civil judges.</li> <li>13 February: Two police officers were killed while defusing a bomb near a bus stop on Sariab Road in Quetta (Balochistan province); nine people were injured.</li> <li>13 February: A suicide bombing near the Provincial Assembly of Punjab on Mall Road in Lahore. The Islamist extremist Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JA) group – an offshoot of the TTP – claimed responsibility for the attack.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Heightened security should be expected in the coming days around potential targets, including government buildings, educational institutions and crowded public areas, in the capital Islamabad and other major cities such as Karachi (Sindh province), Lahore, Rawalpindi (both Punjab province) and Peshawar (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province). Members should observe precautions and comply with all security force directives.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><ul> <li>Travel to most parts of Pakistan can continue with stringent security measures; these include maintaining a low profile and implementing a thorough and robust journey management plan. </li> <li>Travellers should avoid crowded areas, such as open air-markets and public transport hubs, and minimise time spent around likely targets for militant attacks, both stationary and in transit; these include: security force personnel and installations, mosques, Shia Muslim and Christian religious gatherings, and densely populated unsecured areas such as markets, shopping malls and hotels. </li> <li>Although hotels are a potential target for Islamist militant attacks, we continue to advise business travellers to stay at international-standard hotels in Pakistan due to robust security measures in place. Minimise exposure to more likely targets including the lobby, car park and entrance. </li> <li>Anticipate increased scrutiny, including additional police patrols and spot-checks. Comply promptly with all instructions issued by the security forces and carry personal identification documents to facilitate movement through checkpoints. </li> <li>Monitor our alerts on Pakistan for further developments.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>Despite a series of terrorist incidents during February, there are no indications of an imminent militant plot. It is more likely that the alerts were issued amid concerns over militant attacks in retaliation for an ongoing counter-terrorism operation launched in response to recent incidents.</p>\n<p>Militant groups remain active in major urban centres in Pakistan; their operations have primarily focused on security force and government infrastructure and personnel, as well as religious minorities, though soft targets such as markets, parks and other low-security areas where large crowds gather are also vulnerable. Attacks targeting high-security facilities such as business-class hotels, international schools and diplomatic missions, while impossible to rule out, remain significantly less likely.</p>\n<p><em>Security measures</em></p>\n<p>Stringent security checks and other measures can be expected around potential targets in major cities and key routes around the country. In Karachi, the authorities have identified the Sindh High Court, Sindh Assembly, Empress Market, Zainab Market, markets at MA Jinnah Road and restaurants at Do Darya in DHA on Sea View Road as potential targets.</p>\n<p>In Peshawar and Khyber Pakhtunhwa provinces, joint checkpoints have been established on the M1 route connecting Peshawar to Rawalpindi and Islamabad, as well as on the M2 linking Lahore to Rawalpindi and Islamabad. In the capital, security has been increased in Sectors F-6, F-7, F-10 and G-6, as well as in the Blue Area, the main commercial hub, and the Red Zone, where government buildings, the diplomatic enclave and upscale business-class hotels are located.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>Several militant groups maintain recruiting and operational cells in the country, including the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP, the Pakistani Taliban), Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ) and the international terrorist network al-Qaida. Meanwhile, the extremist Islamic State (IS) group's claim of responsibility for a 16 February bombing in Sehwan Sharif (Sindh) underlines the Middle East-based terrorist group's increasing operational capabilities in Pakistan.</p> <p>While IS is not known to have a strong presence in the country, a number of defectors from domestic militant organisations are believed to have pledged allegiance to the group. Given Pakistan's entrenched terrorist network, the risk of further successful militant attacks will persist.</p>\n</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Although the motive for the incident is unknown, the accused perpetrator, who was arrested at the scene, is reportedly a drug addict with mental health problems. The incident is a reminder of the need to avoid low-income areas where there is a higher risk of exposure to criminal activity, particularly the use of weapons in public places, which can pose considerable incidental risks to bystanders. Members in the Philippines should exercise heightened caution and observe security measures at all times.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><ul> <li>High rates of crime pose a significant risk to travellers and expatriates. Members should adopt practical security precautions, including varying their day-to-day routines as far as possible, adopting a low profile by avoiding ostentatious displays of wealth during any travel and maintaining heightened awareness of their surroundings at all times.</li> <li>If threatened or targeted, travellers should seek immediate assistance from the police, their embassy or consulate, and the travel security team of International SOS. </li> <li>Criminals are commonly armed; if targeted, do nothing to resist or antagonise your assailant.</li> <li>To minimise the risk of falling victim to crime, avoid known trouble spots and minimise time on foot, especially after dark. A local contact or hotel concierge may be able to provide the latest information on such trouble spots.</li> <li>The above advice is not exhaustive; please seek itinerary-specific, pre-travel advice, and refer to our Standing Travel Advice for the Philippines.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>Violent crime remains a serious problem, compounded by weak law enforcement and the easy availability of firearms and other weapons. Nonetheless, business travellers who are generally in the country for shorter periods are more vulnerable to petty and opportunistic crime such as theft, pickpocketing and purse snatching. The risk of exposure is high in entertainment areas and crowded public spaces in all major cities and low-income neighbourhoods, with foreigners usually targeted because of their perceived wealth.</p>\n<p>In addition, verbal disputes between foreigners and locals have escalated into more serious acts of violence. Robberies can also result in shoot-outs between suspected criminals and the security forces in public locations, posing incidental risks to bystanders.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Those who are in affected areas should protect themselves against mosquito bites and sexual transmission. After travel to the affected areas, ongoing precautions against sexual transmission are recommended.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><p>Pregnant women, women trying to conceive and their partners are advised to discuss their risks with their doctor and consider postponing travel. Many health authorities advise pregnant women not to travel to areas with active transmission of Zika virus.</p>\n<p>For those who will travel to, or are in the Philippines:</p>\n<ul> <li>Prevent infection by preventing mosquito bites: Use an effective insect repellent that contains DEET, Picaridin, PMD, or IR3535. When outdoors, wear clothing that covers most of your body (long sleeves, long pants, socks). Ensure windows are covered with fly-wire. Consider using an insecticide-treated bed net. Use \"knock-down\" insect spray to kill mosquitoes in your room. Choose air conditioned accommodation if possible.</li> <li>Prevent sexual transmission through the use of condoms (or abstinence).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After travel:</p>\n<ul> <li>Pregnant women - Consult your doctor. You may be advised to be tested for Zika whether or not you develop symptoms. Your doctor may also arrange additional monitoring or specialist care.</li> <li>All travellers - Monitor your health for two weeks. If you develop symptoms, ensure that you see a doctor and advise them of your travel history. This is especially important if you are, or are trying to fall pregnant.</li> <li>Prevent sexual transmission - Anyone who has a pregnant partner should use condoms (applicable to males and females) or abstain for the duration of the pregnancy. For those whose partners are not pregnant, authorities differ in their recommendations for the duration for which precautions should continue. <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/sexual-transmission-prevention/en/\" target=\"_blank\">The World Health Organization advises</a> that everyone should continue precautions for at least 6 months after return. <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/protect-yourself-during-sex.html\" target=\"_blank\">The United States CDC advises</a>: <strong>Men</strong> should continue precautions for at least 6 months; <strong>Women</strong> to continue precautions for at least 8 weeks.</li> <li>Consider delaying pregnancy - The World Health Organization <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/sexual-transmission-prevention/en/\" target=\"_blank\">recommends</a> couples or women planning a pregnancy, who have returned from an area with Zika transmission, to wait at least 6 months. The United States CDC <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/pregnancy/women-and-their-partners.html\" target=\"_blank\">recommends</a> women trying to get pregnant wait at least 8 weeks and partners of women trying to get pregnant wait at least 6 months.</li> <li>Prevent transmission to local mosquitoes. If you are returning to an area that has mosquitoes which can transmit Zika, continue to prevent mosquito bites for 2 to 3 weeks (e.g. using insect repellent). This will reduce the risk of infecting local mosquitoes with Zika, and therefore reduce the risk of an outbreak.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>At least 57 cases of locally acquired Zika infection have been confirmed since September 2016. Cases have been reported from the regions of Calabarzon, Central Luzon, Central Visayas, Western Visayas, and the NCR. Prior to this, locally-transmitted Zika cases were reported in 2012. Sporadic cases have been documented since, including in travellers visiting Philippines.</p> <p>Authorities anticipate further cases and have intensified mosquito control activities. Zika may be established in the local mosquito population in parts of the Philippines, however the extent and intensity of spread is uncertain at this time.</p> <p>What is Zika? <br/> Zika is a viral disease, mostly transmitted to people by mosquito bites. Zika virus can be passed from an infected pregnant mother to her baby. Spread through sexual contact occurs. Transmission via blood transfusion has been reported. Most people who have Zika infections do not have any symptoms. If symptoms occur, they are similar to chikungunya or dengue, and include fever, rash, joint and muscle pains or conjunctivitis (red eyes), and typically last up to a week. The virus can cause severe irreversible birth defects, such as \"microcephaly\" (a small head with developmental abnormalities), and serious neurological complications. There is no specific treatment available, and no vaccine to prevent the disease. <br/> <br/> For more information: </p> <ul> <li>See the <a href=\"https://pandemic.internationalsos.com/zika\" target=\"_blank\">International SOS Zika website</a> </li> <li>See th International SOS Country Guide for Philippines</li> </ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>Further cases are likely to occur.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice for managers</b></p><p>If relevant to your employees or travellers, ensure they are aware of </p>\n<ul> <li>Regional health threats including Zika, who is most at risk (such as pregnant women), and prevention strategies. </li> <li>Who to contact for advice and treatment if they get sick during or after travel. </li> <li>How to access bite prevention resources including insect repellent and bed nets. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consider: </p>\n<ul> <li>Providing a travel health kit, including insect repellent. </li> <li>Stipulating a medical pre-travel consultation.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.internationalsos.com//~/media/dynamic-content/alert-maps/february-2017/philizika.jpg\"/></p>]]>"

When undertaking essential road travel, do not self-drive; use an experienced and trusted local driver and ensure your vehicle is in good condition.

Mine infrastructure has been targeted; time on site should be minimised as far as is possible.</li> <li>The above advice is not exhaustive; monitor our alerts on the Philippines for notable developments and contact the nearest Assistance Centre for profile- and itinerary-specific advice prior to travel. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul> </ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>The president cancelled the peace talks and government ceasefire on 4 February following a series of NPA rebel attacks on security forces and installations. Beginning on 29 January, the most notable of these attacks were in Isabela province (Luzon island) and Agusan del Norte, Cotabato, Sarangani and Surigao del Norte provinces (all Mindanao island). The NPA had announced the termination of a five-month ceasefire of its own on 1 February, claiming delays to the release of political prisoners, among other issues.</p>\n<p>Ceasefires between the CPP-NPA and the government have been periodically called and terminated since the late 1980s, with both sides trading accusations of truce violations. Hostilities often resume after a ceasefire ends, meaning sporadic attacks by the NPA can be expected. NPA activity largely consists of a well-established pattern of hit-and-run incidents, entailing clashes between the rebels and the security forces. The generally rural location of such incidents and the short-lived duration of individual confrontations mean that they pose only a limited threat to business travellers. </p>\n<p>NPA operations can also include raids against plantations, mining compounds and factories that refuse to meet extortion demands. Although the rebel group refers to these demands as a 'revolutionary tax', such raids are largely driven by criminal motives. They tend to involve acts of arson and vandalism of equipment rather than targeting personnel. However, employees based at targeted facilities are occasionally exposed to risks. </p>\n<p><em>Security measures</em></p>\n<p>Heightened security measures, including increased military patrols and vehicle checks, should be expected, particularly in the aforementioned areas where the NPA is active. Extra security personnel are likely to be deployed along routes in insurgency-affected areas, including the Pan-Philippine Highway, potentially causing minor delays to road travel. </p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Travel to south-western Mindanao should be for essential purposes only. Avoid all travel to the Sulu archipelago due to the risks posed by insurgent and associated criminal activity.</li> <li>Trips to coastal resorts and islands should be arranged through reputable tour operators and include comprehensive itinerary and accommodation details. Travellers should select accommodation based on thorough research into and professional advice on security infrastructure, facilities, location and access to support. At a minimum, travellers should select guest rooms that do not have direct access to the waterfront.</li> <li>Criminals, including kidnappers, are commonly armed; if targeted, avoid doing anything to resist or antagonise your assailant.</li> <li>Monitor our alerts on the Philippines for notable developments. </li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>The police said the victim had been killed in the Indanan area of Sulu province (Sulu archipelago), where the ASG is currently holding several others, including foreigners, hostage. The body of the victim's female companion had been found in their abandoned yacht in Sulu in November; reports indicated she had been killed after resisting her captors. </p>\n<p>Abductions, mainly attributed to the ASG, pose a persistent threat to travellers; the threat is highest in the group's strongholds in Basilan and Jolo islands (both Sulu archipelago) and coastal or rural areas of southern and western Mindanao, namely Cotabato, Lanaodel Norte, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sultan Kudarat provinces and the Zamboanga Peninsula. While foreigners, especially those with Filipino relatives or living within Filipino communities, have been targeted for kidnapping, affluent locals, especially members of the ethnic Filipino-Chinese community, are usually the main targets. </p>\n<em>\n<p>Background</p>\n</em>\n<p>The latest abduction is at least the second such incident involving German nationals. In April 2015, ASG abducted two German nationals from their yacht off the coast of Bataraza (Palawan province, Luzon island); the victims spent six months in captivity and were released only after a ransom was paid. </p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>Kidnap for ransom is a common fundraising tactic of semi-autonomous criminal gangs that now largely comprise the ASG. Foreigners are considered prime targets as they command high ransom payments. Abductions have primarily occurred in eastern coastal areas of Sabah state (Malaysia); however, significantly increased security measures along the Sabah coast have limited the ASG's ability to carry out further successful raids in the area.</p>\n<p>Since 2016, the ASG has increasingly turned to the kidnapping of local and foreign tugboat crew, usually Indonesian and Malaysian nationals, operating in international waters off the Sulu archipelago. Such incidents have occurred despite ongoing military offensives against the ASG in its strongholds, as well as co-ordination between the navies of the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia in patrolling their sea borders. This illustrates the intent and capability of the ASG to carry out operations – including those targeting foreigners – in the Sulu Sea, as well as along the vulnerable southern and western coasts of Mindanao.</p>\n<p>There are concerns that ASG's pledges of support for the Iraq- and Syria-based Islamic State (IS) extremist group help drive abductions and beheadings of foreign hostages. It is possible that Mindanao-based Islamists are emulating killings of captive foreigners by other militant groups to gain greater credibility within the wider global jihadist network and exert pressure on subsequent ransom negotiations. However, beheadings are likely to remain isolated and the ASG's focus will continue to be on lucrative abductions; it should be noted that the release of Indonesian and Malaysian hostages in 2016 likely took place following payment of ransom.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Affected places include Alasyah, Al Makhwah, Alzulfi, Bisha, Hail, Hafr Albatin, Jeddah, Khaybar, Makkah, Madinah, Muhayl, Najran and Riyadh. Most of the cases are primary and some have underlying health problems. Contact tracing is underway.</p>\n<p>Some people who have tested positive for the virus have no symptoms, some have had a mild illness, while others are critically ill, and fatalities continue to be reported. The risk of severe illness is higher among people with chronic diseases or a weakened immune system. Overall the risk has not changed. While the virus can be transmitted from one person to another, this has generally occurred between close contacts in households, and in healthcare facilities.</p>\n<p>\nWhat is MERS-CoV?\n</p>\n<p>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), known previously as \"novel coronavirus\", was first identified in humans in 2012. It is from the same family of viruses as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), the coronavirus family. Most cases have originated from the Middle East, although a large outbreak associated with hospitals occurred in South Korea in 2015. While some people may have no symptoms at all, others may have a fever and cough. Some, particularly those with underlying health issues, progress to a severe disease with pneumonia and respiratory failure. About 30-40% of cases are fatal. There is no specific treatment and no vaccine available.\n</p>\n<p>Direct contact with dromedary camels, consuming undercooked camel meat, or drinking raw camel products (milk, urine etc) are risk factors for infection. Spread can occur from one person to others in close contact, possibly through infected respiratory droplets. Outbreaks and clusters of infection have occurred in the healthcare environment and within household.</p>\n<p>For more information:</p>\n<ul> <li>See the dedicated MERS-CoV pages of the International SOS Pandemic Preparedness website</li> <li>About MERS-CoV: see the article \"coronavirus\" on the Disease and Prevention dropdown on the International SOS country guides</li> <li>Contact any International SOS assistance centre</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>Sporadic cases are likely to continue. Cases may be exported by travellers from Saudi Arabia to other countries. Clusters of infection may occur within healthcare settings if appropriate infection control practices are not implemented as soon as patients enter facilities.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice for managers</b></p><p>\nIf relevant to your employees or travellers, ensure they are aware of:</p>\n<ul> <li>Regional health threats including MERS-CoV, who is most at risk (especially people who have pre-existing illnesses and healthcare workers), and prevention strategies. </li> <li>Who to contact for advice and treatment if they get sick during or after travel.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Many health authorities including the United States CDC and the World Health Organization advise pregnant women not to travel to areas with active transmission of Zika virus. </p>\n<p>For those who will travel to, or are in Singapore: </p>\n<ul> <li>Prevent infection by preventing mosquito bites: Use an effective insect repellent that contains DEET, Picaridin, PMD, or IR3535. When outdoors, wear clothing that covers most of your body (long sleeves, long pants, socks). Ensure windows are covered with fly-wire. Consider using an insecticide-treated bed net. Use \"knock-down\" insect spray to kill mosquitoes in your room. Choose air conditioned accommodation if possible. </li> <li>Prevent sexual transmission through the use of condoms (or abstinence). </li>\n</ul>\nAfter Travel:\n<ul> <li>Pregnant women - Consult your doctor. You may be advised to be tested for Zika whether or not you develop symptoms. Your doctor may also arrange additional monitoring or specialist care. </li> <li>All travellers - Monitor your health for two weeks. If you develop symptoms, ensure that you see a doctor and advise them of your travel history. This is especially important if you are, or are trying to fall pregnant. </li> <li>Prevent sexual transmission - Anyone who has a pregnant partner should use condoms (applicable to males and females) or abstain for the duration of the pregnancy. For those whose partners are not pregnant, authorities differ in their recommendations for the duration for which precautions should continue. <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/sexual-transmission-prevention/en/\" target=\"_blank\">The World Health Organization advises</a> that everyone should continue precautions for at least 6 months after return. <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/protect-yourself-during-sex.html\" target=\"_blank\">The United States CDC advises</a>: <strong>Men</strong> should continue precautions for at least 6 months; <strong>Women </strong>to continue precautions for at least 8 weeks. </li> <li>Consider delaying pregnancy - The World Health Organization <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/sexual-transmission-prevention/en/\" target=\"_blank\">recommends</a> couples or women planning a pregnancy, who have returned from an area with Zika transmission, to wait at least 6 months. The United States CDC <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/pregnancy/women-and-their-partners.html\" target=\"_blank\">recommend</a> women trying to get pregnant wait at least 8 weeks and partners of women trying to get pregnant wait at least 6 months. </li> <li>Prevent transmission to local mosquitoes. If you are returning to an area that has mosquitoes which can transmit Zika, continue to prevent mosquito bites for 2 to 3 weeks (e.g. using insect repellent). This will reduce the risk of infecting local mosquitoes with Zika, and therefore reduce the risk of an outbreak.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>A number of authorities, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to Singapore due to the Zika outbreak. Over 350 people have been confirmed to have acquired the infection locally via mosquito bites. Investigations are ongoing and health authorities have screened close contacts of confirmed cases as well as others who have had symptoms and may be potentially infected. An intensive awareness and mosquito control campaign is underway.</p>\n<p>What is Zika?</p>\n<p>Zika is a viral disease, mostly transmitted to people by mosquito bites. Zika virus can be passed from an infected pregnant mother to her baby. Spread through sexual contact occurs. Transmission via blood transfusion has been reported. Most people who have Zika infections do not have any symptoms. If symptoms occur, they are similar to chikungunya or dengue, and include fever, rash, joint and muscle pains or conjunctivitis (red eyes), and typically last up to a week. The virus can cause severe irreversible birth defects, such as \"microcephaly\" (a small head with developmental abnormalities), and serious neurological complications. There is no specific treatment available, and no vaccine to prevent the disease. </p>\n<p>For more information:</p>\n<ul> <li>See the <a href=\"http://mailgun.internationalsos.com/c/eJxtjktvgzAQhH8N3Iy8xs-DDxCgQmpOSL1vwQTU8JDtSGl_fX2NlNXcdma-mSx3MM75sEY3Ht710W1fzof12G2ZL3bSoDXOEwJwBXQ2JQJLZ3QpkEmW3-0S4xmysspYl3TiPrltHYt1j87vGFMT3sMRivHY0v9v_cEX2ifutwfenHV7vtqKatWqriaN5kC4EkA0ACVtKaSsWVMJZjJOfXiEsMXzLSX39vT4vWDxxCcm91vT8BsSvZ8sf5nTNzZTtbx0AroGCOXQEW7EhRijDVG1YVK3SknRZKrJP67D1YWQ5qcco1wryv4BncFq3Q\" target=\"_blank\">International SOS Zika website</a></li> <li>See the International SOS Country Guide on Singapore</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>The virus is likely present in the local mosquito population and further human cases may occur.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice for managers</b></p>If relevant to your employees or travellers, ensure they are aware of: <ul> <li>Regional health threats including Zika, who is most at risk (such as pregnant women), and prevention strategies. </li> <li>Who to contact for advice and treatment if they get sick during or after travel. </li> <li>How to access bite prevention resources including insect repellent and bed nets. </li>\n</ul>\nConsider: <ul> <li>Providing a travel health kit, including insect repellent. </li> <li>Stipulating a medical pre-travel consultation.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Members should continue to defer all non-essential travel to Puntland; those currently in Bosaso should avoid the vicinity of the targeted court building and follow all directives issued by the authorities.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><ul> <li>Continue to avoid the vicinity of the regional courthouse in Bosaso and follow all directives issued by the authorities. Liaise with your local security provider regarding the feasibility of movement outside Bosaso. </li> <li>Essential travel to most of Puntland, where the travel risks are rated as HIGH, requires stringent security precautions, including a specific pre-travel threat assessment as part of a comprehensive and fully co-ordinated security programme. Travel to the Galgala mountains and coastal areas east of Bosaso should be deferred. </li> <li>Travellers on long-term assignments should receive hostile environment training prior to deployment. Seek professional 24/7 security support to ensure access to the latest locally sourced threat intelligence, trip-specific assessments, operations-room tracking, reliable communications and immediate access to emergency support. </li> <li>Minimise movement outside secure premises and the time spent around likely targets for militant attacks, both static and in transit. </li> <li>Monitor our Somalia alerts for further information.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>The incident follows a 26 February grenade attack on a checkpoint in Bosaso, in which four soldiers were injured. While the al-Shabab organisation – some of whose members have reportedly been tried at the targeted court – remains the primary Islamist extremist group in Somalia, a pro-Islamic State (IS) faction has recently stepped up its activity in Puntland, killing four security guards in an 8 February attack on the International Village Hotel in Bosaso.</p> <p>The incidence of militancy in Puntland remains generally lower than in southern and central Somalia. However, the recent developments indicate such groups' growing intent to target northern urban centres outside traditional militant strongholds.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>Al-Shabab's capabilities remain far greater than the recently established pro-IS faction. Nevertheless, the presence of two separate groups, possibly competing for territorial dominance, suggests that the militant threat in Puntland may increase in the coming months.</p> <p>This will be exacerbated by the region's financial limitations, overstretched resources and the diminishing capability and poor morale of its security forces, some of whose members on 26 February briefly seized the Puntland parliament building in the regional capital Garowe to demand better working conditions and overdue salaries. Given the above considerations, as well as the lack of secure accommodation options and access to assistance in the territory, we are currently reviewing Puntland's travel risk rating.</p> </p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

In Pattani's Mayo district, at least four people – three soldiers and a security guard – were killed and two civilians injured in two separate attacks. <br/></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><ul> <li>Travel to Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala provinces, as well as the southern districts (Chana, Na Thawi, Saba Yoi and Thepha) of Songkhla province, should be for essential purposes only due to risks posed by the ongoing insurgency.</li> <li>Travellers intending to visit the region should seek itinerary-specific advice and ensure that they have mitigating measures in place prior to travel, including journey management planning, communications protocols and consideration of formal security support. Particular caution is required in the selection of accommodation; overnight stays should be avoided where possible.</li> <li>Rail travel along the south-eastern branch of the southern railway from Hat Yai (Songkhla) to Sungai Kolok (Narathiwat) should be avoided, as separatist insurgents have previously attacked the track, rolling stock and stations on this line.</li> <li>Reduce your exposure to potential targets for militant attacks, which primarily include security force personnel and convoys, checkpoints, police stations, government buildings, schools, religious sites. Remain vigilant at all times; report any suspicious behaviour or suspect packages to the authorities.</li> <li>Monitor our alerts on Thailand for related updates.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p>The incidents came two days after peace talks held in Malaysia between the government and the militant umbrella organisation MARA Patani, during which both sides agreed to establish safety zones in five districts in the southern provinces. While MARA Patani claims to represent the main militant groups, it does not control all insurgent groups on the ground, including the Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) – the region's most capable militant organisation. Groups not aligned with MARA Patani have launched attacks in the past to demonstrate their disagreement with peace talks. </p>\n<p>The majority of separatist activity will continue to be directed at the security forces, with other common targets including farmers, Buddhist monks and teachers. However, the targeting pattern of militant groups has increasingly involved indiscriminately attacking civilians with explosives. Co-ordinated bombings during the 11-12 August 2016 holiday marking Queen Sirikit's birthday killed four civilians and injured more than 20 others, including ten foreigners. There is a continued potential for occasional attacks on 'soft' targets such as hotels, schools and crowded marketplaces in regional urban centres. Attacks against transport infrastructure, particularly trains running between Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat, occur occasionally.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p>Prospects for the success of the peace talks remain poor, which is likely to exacerbate disagreements between various insurgent factions and prompt further attacks. Previously, efforts by the government and MARA Patani to implement a ceasefire zone in Narathiwat resulted in militants seizing a civilian hospital in March 2016. Militants have typically launched attacks around significant dates and events to signal their intentions and demonstrate capability. Trends suggest the potential for militant attacks outside of the southern provinces around key dates and sensitive anniversaries.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

After travel to the affected areas, ongoing precautions against sexual transmission are recommended.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><p>Pregnant women, women trying to conceive and their partners are advised to discuss their risks with their doctor and consider postponing travel. Many health authorities advise pregnant women not to travel to areas with active transmission of Zika virus. </p>\n<p>For those who will travel to, or are in Thailand:</p>\n<ul> <li>Prevent infection by preventing mosquito bites: Use an effective insect repellent that contains DEET, Picaridin, PMD, or IR3535. When outdoors, wear clothing that covers most of your body (long sleeves, long pants, socks). Ensure windows are covered with fly-wire. Consider using an insecticide-treated bed net. Use \"knock-down\" insect spray to kill mosquitoes in your room. Choose air conditioned accommodation if possible. </li> <li>Prevent sexual transmission through the use of condoms (or abstinence).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After travel:</p>\n<ul> <li>Pregnant women - Consult your doctor. You may be advised to be tested for Zika whether or not you develop symptoms. Your doctor may also arrange additional monitoring or specialist care.</li> <li>All travellers - Monitor your health for two weeks. If you develop symptoms, ensure that you see a doctor and advise them of your travel history. This is especially important if you are, or are trying to fall pregnant. </li> <li>Prevent sexual transmission - Anyone who has a pregnant partner should use condoms (applicable to males and females) or abstain for the duration of the pregnancy. For those whose partners are not pregnant, authorities differ in their recommendations for the duration for which precautions should continue. <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/sexual-transmission-prevention/en/\" target=\"_blank\">The World Health Organization advises</a> that everyone should continue precautions for at least 6 months after return. <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/protect-yourself-during-sex.html\" target=\"_blank\">The United States CDC advises</a>: <strong>Men</strong> should continue precautions for at least 6 months; <strong>Women</strong> to continue precautions for at least 8 weeks</li> <li>Consider delaying pregnancy - The World Health Organization <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/sexual-transmission-prevention/en/\" target=\"_blank\">recommends</a> couples or women planning a pregnancy, who have returned from an area with Zika transmission, to wait at least 6 months. The United States CDC <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/pregnancy/women-and-their-partners.html\" target=\"_blank\">recommends</a> women trying to get pregnant wait at least 8 weeks and partners of women trying to get pregnant wait at least 6 months.</li> <li>Prevent transmission to local mosquitoes. If you are returning to an area that has mosquitoes which can transmit Zika, continue to prevent mosquito bites for 2 to 3 weeks (e.g. using insect repellent). This will reduce the risk of infecting local mosquitoes with Zika, and therefore reduce the risk of an outbreak.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>The first locally-transmitted cases of Zika virus were reported in 2012. Sporadic cases have been documented since then, including in travellers after they left Thailand. In 2016, over 350 local cases were recorded from at least 15 provinces, including of Bangkok, Bueng karn, Chanthaburi, Chiangmai and Phetchaboon. </p>\n<p>What is Zika?</p>\n<p>Zika is a viral disease, mostly transmitted to people by mosquito bites. Zika virus can be passed from an infected pregnant mother to her baby. Spread through sexual contact occurs. Transmission via blood transfusion has been reported. Most people who have Zika infections do not have any symptoms. If symptoms occur, they are similar to chikungunya or dengue, and include fever, rash, joint and muscle pains or conjunctivitis (red eyes), and typically last up to a week. The virus can cause severe irreversible birth defects, such as \"microcephaly\" (a small head with developmental abnormalities), and serious neurological complications. There is no specific treatment available, and no vaccine to prevent the disease.</p>\n<p>For more information:</p>\n<ul> <li>See the <a href=\"https://pandemic.internationalsos.com/zika\" target=\"_blank\">International SOS Zika website</a></li> <li>See the International SOS Country Guide for Thailand</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>There is an ongoing risk of Zika in Thailand, further cases are likely to occur. </p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice for managers</b></p><p>If relevant to your employees or travellers, ensure they are aware of\n</p>\n<ul> <li>Regional health threats including Zika, who is most at risk (such as pregnant women), and prevention strategies. </li> <li>Who to contact for advice and treatment if they get sick during or after travel. </li> <li>How to access bite prevention resources including insect repellent and bed nets. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consider:</p>\n<ul> <li>Providing a travel health kit, including insect repellent. </li> <li>Stipulating a medical pre-travel consultation.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.internationalsos.com//~/media/dynamic-content/alert-maps/october-2016/thai-zika-map.jpg\"/></p>]]>"

Meningococcal meningitis is a serious bacterial infection that can be rapidly life-threatening. Anyone can be affected, although infants, adolescents and college students are at higher risk. It spreads from person-to-person via infected droplets. Symptoms include fever, intense headache, vomiting, neck stiffness and coma. Severe cases develop a characteristic rash all over the body. It can be treated with antibiotics. A vaccine is available.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p>Do the following:\n<ul> <li>Consider receiving the quadrivalent meningitis vaccine (serogroups A, C, Y and W135) before arrival in Togo. See your travel health practitioner prior to departure for an individual recommendation.</li> <li>Maintain strict personal hygiene.</li> <li>Avoid crowds in outbreak areas.</li> <li>Do not have close contact (such as kissing) with potentially infected people.</li> <li>Wash your hands frequently whether you are sick or healthy.</li> <li>If you develop symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>Cases of suspected meningococcal meningitis have been reported since the beginning of the year. Some deaths have also occurred. Lab tests have confirmed Neisseria meningitis infection in a few patients. Surveillance has been strengthened and vaccination camps are being planned.</p>\nTogo lies in the African meningitis belt and cases and deaths occur almost every year. A large outbreak was recorded in 2016 as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is meningitis?<br/>\nThere are several forms of meningitis, viral and bacterial. Bacterial meningitis is caused by various pathogens including Nisseria meningitidis which causes meningococcal meningitis.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeningococcal meningitis is one of the most severe forms and often becomes fatal. People can contract this disease if they inhale droplets that have been coughed or sneezed into the air by an infected person. Direct contact with an infected person's throat secretions (e.g. through kissing, sharing drinks) can also spread the disease. Typically, epidemics of meningococcal meningitis occur among people who live in close quarters. The bacterium invades the brain and its linings and can multiply in the blood (septicaemia). A characteristic red, blotchy rash occurs all over the body in most serious cases. Symptoms include fever, intense headache, vomiting, and neck stiffness. These may progress to cause coma. It is essential that infected people are evaluated by a physician immediately and receive antibiotics quickly, as the disease progresses rapidly and can cause permanent brain damage or death. Vaccines against some strains of the disease are available.<br/>\n<br/>\nViral meningitis, also called aseptic meningitis, is an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by a group of viruses called enteroviruses. These are spread through the respiratory secretions and faeces of an infected person. The classic symptoms, which usually come on quickly, are fever, headache and stiff neck. These symptoms may often occur together with nausea, vomiting, photophobia (sensitivity to light) and altered mental status (confusion).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no vaccine for viral meningitis, and no specific treatment for it. Most people recover in about a week. There are no long term complications.<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>For more information:</p>\n<ul> <li>See the article \"Meningococcal meningitis\" in the \"Disease &amp; Prevention\" dropdown on International SOS Country Guides</li> <li>See Togo on the International SOS Country Guides</li> <li>Contact any International SOS assistance centre</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n</p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>Meningitis is endemic (consistently present) in Togo.

Several factors contribute to the underlying terrorist threat, including Tunisia's geographical position between two countries with a known and entrenched Islamist militant presence (Algeria and Libya), as well as its Western-leaning and secularist tradition and the presence – albeit declining – of foreign tourists and expatriates.</p>\n<p>Security operations are regularly conducted and terrorist cells dismantled, most recently, according to reports on 11 February, in Monastir province, where six suspects were arrested in a security operation. According to the interior ministry, the suspects are accused of hiring militant fighters for the extremist Islamic State (IS) group in Syria.</p>\n<p>In Tunisia, Islamist militants are known to seek shelter in mountainous areas of Jendouba, Kasserine and Kef provinces, near the western border with Algeria. However, terrorist incidents in the Ben Gardane area (Medenine province) in 2016 showed the potential for Islamist extremist activity to also spill over from Libya. Recent developments in that country have also fuelled concerns over the potential return to Tunisia of militants who have fought for IS.</p>\n</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

This is a much higher rate than usually seen in returning travellers and there appears to be a clustering of cases corresponding with travel to Dubai between 10-23 October 2016. This coincides with annual school holidays in a number of EU countries. Most of the cases were 50 years or older and new infections continue to be reported up to the end of December 2016.</p>\n<p>The cases were spread over more than 20 accommodation sites in Dubai, some of which had been implicated in previous years' cases of TALD. Authorities in the UAE have investigated the notified hotels, and report that regular monitoring and additional testing for Legionella bacteria has been negative. A few cases have also been identified in people who were not in hotels but stayed in private homes. Given the widespread geography, it is unlikely that accommodation is the source of exposure. Other locations are likely to be the source although no common place has yet been pinpointed.</p>\n<p>Whether there is also an increase in cases of Legionnaire's disease in the local community is unknown at this stage. </p>\n<p><em>What is Legionnaires' disease? </em></p>\n<p>Legionnaires' disease is caused by Legionella bacteria, which are naturally present in the environment. Some strains are present in soil or potting mix, however, they are most commonly found in water. The bacteria grow best in warm environments such as hot tubs, cooling towers, hot water tanks, large plumbing systems, and air-conditioning systems of buildings. People become infected when they breathe in contaminated water droplets, like steam from a contaminated hot tub. Legionnaires' disease does not spread from person-to-person. It does not spread via drinking water. </p>\n<p>Symptoms usually start within 2-10 days (but can be as long as 19 days) and may include fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, diarrhoea, dry cough and difficulty breathing. Some people only develop a flu-like illness, while others get pneumonia. Most healthy people recover well when treated with antibiotics. Pneumonia caused by Legionella can be serious and is fatal in 5% to 30% of all cases. </p>\n<p>Some people are at a higher risk of infection. Anyone over the age of 50, smokers and former smokers, diabetics, and people with chronic lung conditions (like emphysema or asthma) or other chronic medical conditions like heart and liver disease are more likely to be infected. People who are immunosuppressed, such as those with HIV or on chemotherapy, are also at risk for more serious infections. </p>\n<p>For more information: </p>\n<ul> <li>See the article \"Legionnaires' Disease\" in the Diseases and Prevention dropdown on International SOS Country Guides </li> <li>Contact any International SOS assistance centre</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/>\n</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>Further cases in travellers who have visited Dubai, and those who reside in Dubai may occur. </p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Zika virus can be passed from an infected pregnant mother to her baby. Spread through sexual contact occurs. Transmission via blood transfusion has occurred. Most people who have Zika infections do not have any symptoms. If symptoms occur, they are similar to chikunguyna or dengue, and include fever, rash, joint and muscle pains or conjunctivitis (red eyes), and typically last up to a week. The virus can cause severe irreversible birth defects, such as \"microcephaly\" (a small head with developmental abnormalities), and serious neurological complications. There is no specific treatment available, and no vaccine to prevent the disease.\n</p>\n<p>For more information:</p>\n<ul> <li>See the <a href=\"https://pandemic.internationalsos.com/zika\" target=\"_blank\">International SOS Zika website</a>.</li> <li>See \"Zika virus\" in the Diseases and Prevention dropdown on International SOS Country Guides.</li> <li>Contact any International SOS assistance centre.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p>There is potential for additional Zika cases in the identified areas as well as geographical spread to near-by locations.

Pregnant women are advised to discuss their risks with their doctor and consider postponing travel to any area where Zika virus transmission is ongoing. Those who are in affected areas should protect themselves against mosquito bites and sexual transmission. After travel, ongoing precautions against sexual transmission are recommended.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p>Pregnant women, women trying to conceive and their partners are advised to discuss their risks with their doctor and consider postponing travel to any area where Zika virus transmission is ongoing. In addition to the infectious risks of any destination, it is important to consider the standard of available healthcare, and the availability of obstetric and neonatal specialist support (should it be required). Pregnant women - discuss your risks with your doctor, including whether you should postpone travel.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who will travel to, or are in Vietnam:\n<br/>\n<ul> <li>Prevent infection by preventing mosquito bites: Use an effective insect repellent that contains DEET, Picaridin, PMD, or IR3535. When outdoors, wear clothing that covers most of your body (long sleeves, long pants, socks). Ensure windows are covered with fly-wire. Consider using an insecticide-treated bed net. Use \"knock-down\" insect spray to kill mosquitoes in your room. Choose air conditioned accommodation if possible.</li> <li>Prevent sexual transmission through the use of condoms (or abstinence).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After travel:\n</p>\n<ul> <li>Pregnant women - Consult your doctor. You may be advised to be tested for Zika whether or not you develop symptoms. Your doctor may also arrange additional monitoring or specialist care. </li> <li>All travellers - Monitor your health for two weeks. </li> <li>If you develop symptoms, ensure that you see a doctor and advise them of your travel history. This is especially important if you are, or are trying to fall pregnant.</li> <li>Prevent sexual transmission - Anyone who has a pregnant partner should use condoms (applicable to males and females) or abstain for the duration of the pregnancy. For those whose partners are not pregnant, authorities differ in their recommendations for the duration for which precautions should continue. The <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/sexual-transmission-prevention/en/\" target=\"_blank\">World Health Organization</a> advises that everyone should continue precautions for at least 6 months after return. The <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/protect-yourself-during-sex.html\" target=\"_blank\">United States CDC</a> advises: Men should continue precautions for at least 6 months; Women should continue precautions for at least 8 weeks. </li> <li>Consider delaying pregnancy - The <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/sexual-transmission-prevention/en/\" target=\"_blank\">World Health Organization</a> recommends couples or women planning a pregnancy, who have returned from an area with Zika transmission, to wait at least 6 months. The <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/pregnancy/women-and-their-partners.html\" target=\"_blank\">United States CDC</a> recommend women trying to get pregnant wait at least 8 weeks and partners of women trying to get pregnant wait at least 6 months. </li> <li>Prevent transmission to local mosquitoes. If you are returning to an area that has mosquitoes which can transmit Zika, continue to prevent mosquito bites for 2 to 3 weeks (e.g. using insect repellent). This will reduce the risk of infecting local mosquitoes with Zika, and therefore reduce the risk of an outbreak.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>Since 2016, there have been over 200 cases of locally-acquired Zika infection nationwide affecting at least 11 cities and provinces. The majority of these are from Ho Chi Minh city. At least 20 out of 24 districts in the city have reported cases. Sporadic cases have been detected in travellers visiting Vietnam.\nZika may have been established in the local mosquito population in parts of the Vietnam, however the extent and intensity of spread is uncertain at this time.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is Zika?\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZika is a viral disease, mostly transmitted to people by mosquito bites. Zika virus can be passed from an infected pregnant mother to her baby. Spread through sexual contact occurs. Transmission via blood transfusion has been reported. Most people who have Zika infections do not have any symptoms. If symptoms occur, they are similar to chikungunya or dengue, and include fever, rash, joint and muscle pains or conjunctivitis (red eyes), and typically last up to a week. The virus can cause severe irreversible birth defects, such as \"microcephaly\" (a small head with developmental abnormalities), and serious neurological complications. There is no specific treatment available, and no vaccine to prevent the disease.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information:\n</p>\n<ul> <li>See the <a href=\"https://pandemic.internationalsos.com/zika\" target=\"_blank\">International SOS Zika website</a>.</li> <li>See the International SOS Country Guide on Vietnam.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>The situation is continuing to evolve. The transmission intensity is uncertain. An increase in cases is likely as screening and testing is increased.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Liaise with local contacts and ensure that there is no rally taking place in the vicinity before visiting facilities or locations that may be mistaken as being Chinese and Taiwanese (for example, as a result of corporate branding).</li> <li>All ethnic-Chinese travellers should keep a low profile as a routine precaution. Those who are not Chinese or Taiwanese nationals (for example, ethnic-Chinese Singaporean) should be aware of their profile and take steps to denote their nationality, such as carrying passport identification. Chinese and Taiwanese nationals should avoid overt displays of nationality.</li> <li>If inadvertently caught up in a demonstration or if protesters and/or the security forces begin to gather, quickly but calmly leave the area and relocate to a secure location such as your local office or accommodation. Do not stop to watch or photograph rallies.</li> <li>Monitor our alerts on Vietnam for further updates.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p><p>Protests over the alleged pollution began in April 2016 in the country's major cities, particularly over the weekends. Demonstrations in major cities are likely remain small and peaceful, with participants likely to engage in picketing, sit-ins and - at most - minor acts of vandalism such as throwing paint at diplomatic missions. Nonetheless, scuffles between the police and demonstrators have occurred during previous events, with the former using batons and checkpoints and security cordons to control the unrest.</p>\n<p>In recent months, protesters have rallied in Ha Tinh, Nghe An and Quang Binh. Most recently on 14 February, hundreds of protesters from Quynh Luu district (Nghe An province) marched to People's Court in Ky Anh (Ha Tinh province) to file a petition, but were stopped on the way; scuffles between protesters and police were reported. On 5 February, several hundred residents protested at the local government offices in the Quang Loc commune of Ba Don town (Quang Binh). Prior to this, hundreds of demonstrators blocked parts of National Highway 1A on 14 and 23 January, resulting in congestion.</p>\n<p>The majority of protests have so far occurred in Ha Tinh, with activists belonging to a local Roman Catholic diocese heeding calls from priests to march peacefully. The Catholic community in Vietnam has periodically held demonstrations over environmental or land acquisition grievances. Nonetheless, such demonstrations do not pose a serious challenge to broader social or governmental stability.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><b>Assessment</b></p><p>Although there have been attempts to equate the current protests with a bout of social unrest in May 2014 that targeted Chinese nationals and interests, as well as individuals and interests perceived to be of Chinese origin, we do not assess this to be the case. Those incidents occurred during a period of particularly acute diplomatic tension between Vietnam and China.</p>\n<p>Since the May 2014 demonstrations, which quickly escalated, Vietnam has taken significant steps to prevent a repeat of such incidents, such as providing physical security to Chinese-owned facilities deemed vulnerable. Chinese nationals and interests, as well as individuals who may be mistaken for Chinese nationals, should nonetheless be aware that their profile makes them vulnerable to low-level verbal harassment. However, physical assaults of such individuals should remain rare.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"
